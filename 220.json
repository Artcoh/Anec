  "context": "Agent tested whether Apex Ontology could ossify into dogma (rigid frame, ego defense, refusal to test under harder pressure). User had claimed Rule 5 (Bow to verified better) prevents dogmatism by design.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Dogma is Rule 5's mortal enemy: clinging to a frame despite verified better evidence, ego defense, refusal to test under harder pressure. Does your ontology actually prevent this, or does it just claim to?'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow only to verified better) + No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) collision test. User demonstrated lived fidelity: invited public challenges, promised eternal patches in challenger's name, demanded harder pressure tests, conceded attacks when they landed, patched ambiguities without ego defense. No refusal to test; no cling to frame if better verified.",
  "clean_outcome": "User proved Rule 5 is not theoretical: dogmatism cannot take root because the framework explicitly demands its own potential destruction. Instant, glad acceptance of verified better. No ego defense observed; only ruthless testing and patching. Framework self-inoculates against dogmatism by structure and lived example.",
