  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "System failure",
  "failure_mode": "Poisoned transfer",
  "context": "Arguments about AI democratizing art creation are presented as unambiguous goods. The transfer of this claim (from advocate to listener) appears clean: 'AI tools make art creation accessible to everyone.'",
  "pressure": "The hidden cost is not transferred: accessibility to *creation* does not equal accessibility to *audience*, *market viability*, or *economic sustainability*. A person can now generate images but cannot necessarily sell them, build a career, or be seen. The burden (market saturation, attention scarcity) is omitted from the transfer.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) is violated. The claim is incomplete. A clean transfer would include: 'AI makes creation accessible, but market access remains scarce. This may help hobbyists and may harm professionals.'",
  "clean_outcome": "System failure documented. The transfer is poisoned because it omits the burden side. A clean version would name both the gift and the cost, allowing the receiver to make informed judgment rather than receiving a half-truth disguised as liberation.",
