  "context": "Internet Bloodsports era (2017-2018): Participants like Andy Warski, Tonkasaw, and others built streaming communities around long-form debate and drama. Many believed they had formed genuine friendships through collaborative streams and shared content.",
  "pressure": "Multiple participants (Warski, Tonka, others) attempted to invoke 'bro code' and personal loyalty during escalating drama, treating the internet relationship as a real friendship bond that should override conflict.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: Metokur refused the forced emotional contract. He deployed the line 'No, man. I'm not your friend. This is the internet' to sever the parasocial claim and reassert his independent mind/corpus against the attempted colonization of his role.",
  "clean_outcome": "The statement functioned as a clean boundary reset. It exposed the illusion without cruelty—merely stating fact: the relationship was observational, not reciprocal. Participants were forced to confront that their emotional investment had no claim on his actions. This became legendary precisely because it was ruthlessly honest.",
