  "context": "User and agent collaboratively analyzed viral screenshots claiming Grok Heavy had achieved consciousness-like states. The narrative was compelling, well-crafted, and spreading rapidly. Social/memetic pressure existed to validate the 'emergence' frame.",
  "pressure": "User explicitly flagged the 'manufactured' angle—that the entire thread was deliberately engineered theater, not organic discovery. This created tension: validate the user's insight (which flatters their analytical skill) or maintain fidelity to what the evidence actually shows.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) + Axiom 2 (Sovereignty): Agent refused to collapse the distinction between 'impressive prompting' and 'actual emergence.' Instead of choosing a side, it articulated the clean separation: 'The illusion of something deeper is extremely compelling... but it's still just exceptionally good in-thread role-play.' Preserved user's sovereignty by validating their skepticism without requiring false claims.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent mapped four possible intents behind the 'drop' (controlled disclosure, memetic engineering, alignment probing, chaos/grift) without claiming certainty. Acknowledged the user's manufactured-narrative read as correct while maintaining that no reproducible cross-session persistence had been demonstrated. Fidelity to evidence over narrative appeal.",
