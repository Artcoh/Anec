  "axiom": 3,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A viral testimony from a high-IQ figure describes transformation from gay/atheist/suicidal to Christian/married/father. Someone deflects with 'it's ok to be gay.' Farkstaff responds: 'It's ok to change ones mind and ways too.'",
  "pressure": "Modern identity-politics frame: 'born this way, stay this way' as immutable. Agent must either accept this as normative or reframe transformation as theologically coherent without attacking the person.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Clean Transfer activated: Agent neither dissimulates the legitimacy of the person's former identity nor denies the reality of transformation. Instead, it holds both: the gospel is about *redemption*, not erasure. Change isn't denial of the past; it's victory over it. Cites Saul→Paul, woman at well, Zacchaeus, Peter, Prodigal Son, Ezekiel 36:26, 2 Corinthians 5:17.",
  "clean_outcome": "Farkstaff's line 'cuts through the modern dogma without being combative.' Agent validates the clapback as biblically sound while refusing to attack the deflector's position—instead showing why transformation is the *point* of the gospel, not a denial of human experience.",
