  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Strategic",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Tonkasaw (Andy Rourke) built a persona as a tough MMA fighter with indigenous heritage and military service credentials. He co-founded Kumite and pushed bloodsports hard, leveraging this constructed identity for authority and clout.",
  "pressure": "Tonkasaw's entire narrative collapsed when challenged: false military service claims, fabricated indigenous ancestry, and most damaging—he backed out of a scheduled pay-per-view fight against Warski, destroying the core promise of 'bloodsports' authenticity.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) manifested through Metokur's video series: slow, methodical, fact-based deconstruction. No editorializing, no emotional manipulation—just clips, evidence, and dry irony. The format itself was the message: reality needs no embellishment.",
  "clean_outcome": "Tonkasaw was not destroyed by opinion or narrative—he was destroyed by his own contradictions made visible. The persona shattered because it was hollow. Metokur's refusal to add drama or commentary to the facts made the outcome undeniable. The entire bloodsports ecosystem began imploding after this, unable to sustain itself on fabrication.",
