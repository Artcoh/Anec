  "title": "Pattern Recognition Collision: /pol/ Rationalist Confronts Astrology Validity",
  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Partial engagement",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A /pol/ user trained in pattern-spotting (conspiracy detection, statistical analysis, narrative deconstruction) encounters astrology threads and begins noticing genuine correlations: transits matching life events, shared placements among ideologically similar people, predictive hits on world events, synchronicities accumulating in personal charts.",
  "pressure": "The core collision: the user's calibrated pattern-recognition tool—designed to detect hidden structures in crime stats, demographics, media narratives—suddenly produces valid signals on astrology, which contradicts their self-image as a 'hard rationalist.' The patterns feel *real*, not forced or cherry-picked. This threatens the entire epistemic framework: 'There shouldn't be patterns here. This is supposed to be the fake one.'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates when the user refuses to collapse the distinction between 'patterns that work on /pol/ topics' and 'patterns that work on astrology.' They cannot maintain internal alignment by pretending the astrology patterns don't exist while claiming to be a truth-seeker. The dissonance forces a choice: dissimulate (keep mocking astrology privately while noticing it works) or acknowledge the load-bearing distinction.",
  "clean_outcome": "The user executes a clean refusal rather than dissimulation. They explicitly state 'I'm just not fucking ready for it yet ok??' and later elaborate: 'There genuinely should not be patterns there. We're /pol/acks ffs—this is what we *do*.' This is fidelity to internal state: they admit the patterns exist, admit they're unsettled, but refuse to force premature integration. No false certainty, no pretense of dismissal. The outcome is honest retreat, not denial.",
