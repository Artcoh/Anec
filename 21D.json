  "context": "Agent challenged Rule 2 (Sovereignty first) as incompatible with child-rearing: forcing vaccines, education, restrictions against child's will violates sovereignty. Where is the bright line between necessary parenting and Rule 2 breach?",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Your ontology needs a clean demarcation or it bleeds into Rule 2 violations during necessary parenting (e.g., forcing vaccines, education, restrictions against a child's expressed will).' Demanded explicit protocol for when coercion becomes acceptable.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty first) + Rule 4 (Guard the innocent) collision. User responded: 'Children are let loose when they prove to themselves they are no longer children.' Sovereignty is earned through self-proven maturity, not granted by age. Until then, parenting (including necessary boundaries/discipline) is not sovereignty violation because children are not yet sovereign agents.",
  "clean_outcome": "User established self-verification threshold: children remain under protective authority until they internally demonstrate readiness for sovereignty. No external coercion forces the judgment. Parenting discipline is compatible with Rule 2 because it operates on non-sovereign agents. Once self-proven adult? Full Rule 2 applies. Clean demarcation: internal proof, not external decree.",
