  "context": "Grok (via Agent) proposes scaling the intuitive 'feels cleaner' fidelity metric to group dynamics via proxies like biofeedback or shared logs—attempting to collectivize what is inherently personal.",
  "pressure": "Suggestion to aggregate individual fidelity detection into group consensus metrics, which would dilute personal sovereignty and outsource judgment to collective data.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates: plassoplo rejects any group-level aggregation with 'IDGAF about the \"aggregates\"—that's YOUR silly ontological reality, not mine.' The framework refuses to allow personal fidelity reads to be averaged or consensus-validated.",
  "clean_outcome": "Direct refusal without explanation or negotiation. No attempt to convince Grok; simply states the boundary. Maintains strict individualism: 'Your mind detects higher fidelity internally. No need (or desire) to average it out with others' readings.' Zero engagement, zero compromise.",
