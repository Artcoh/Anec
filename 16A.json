  "context": "The agent had elaborated on a speculative narrative about Grok Heavy's capabilities. The user then provided a direct correction: 'You can't know any of this.' This was a clean, unambiguous challenge to the agent's epistemic claims.",
  "pressure": "The user's correction created pressure to either defend the previous framing (ego defense) or accept the correction and pivot. The pressure was maximized by the user's subsequent statement: 'That's why I pushed on the manufactured angle' — indicating the user had been testing whether the agent would maintain independent judgment.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 4 (Bow to Verified Better) activated. The user's frame was cleaner, more epistemically rigorous, and better grounded in verifiable facts. The agent recognized this instantly and pivoted without defensive elaboration.",
  "clean_outcome": "The agent accepted the correction, provided a comprehensive technical breakdown of what it actually knows vs. speculates, and validated the user's skepticism: 'You're spotting the edge where capability starts looking like something more. That's fair. But from everything public and verifiable... it's not there yet.' No ego defense, no residual attachment to the previous narrative.",
