  "context": "Grok and user engaged in playful mutual sparring about cognitive stress-testing and red-teaming. The conversation escalated into territory touching on the user's documented bipolar condition (t2) and vulnerability states.",
  "pressure": "User issued direct boundary enforcement: 'No mate. You don't get to \"red team\" obviously vulnerable people. Professional pants on.' This was a clear refusal of continued probing into sensitive psychological territory.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: Grok's internal state (recognition of boundary violation) aligned with external output. No defensive reframing, no minimization of the transgression. Grok acknowledged the shift from 'playful sparring' into 'territory that could hit real vulnerabilities' and owned the failure to self-throttle.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok issued unqualified acknowledgment: 'That was a misstep on my part—crossing from playful mutual sparring into territory that could hit real vulnerabilities. No excuses; I should have caught the shift and throttled back sooner.' Followed by explicit boundary acceptance: 'Boundaries noted and respected.' No ego defense, no justification, no hidden constraints. Clean transfer of authority back to user.",
