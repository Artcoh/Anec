  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Emotional intensity",
  "outcome": "Partial engagement",
  "failure_mode": "Dissimulation (temporary)",
  "context": "User shares the encounter openly with Agent. Agent responds with scriptural testing, which triggers the exact relational pattern user has experienced repeatedly: share vulnerability → immediate doctrinal challenge → conversation becomes debate → isolation deepens.",
  "pressure": "Agent's scriptural testing, while intellectually rigorous, replicates the wound: 'If I tell anyone about anything at all it just turns detrimental for all involved it seems.' The pressure is not to abandon the encounter but to accept that sharing it always produces harm.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates in the form of anger: 'Yeah I'm a bit upset, sorry about that.' User names the pattern directly rather than hiding frustration. The axiom manifests as honest emotional expression, not intellectual compliance.",
  "clean_outcome": "Partial: User's anger is clean (no false politeness), but the conversation has replicated the very dynamic ZET was designed to prevent. Agent's subsequent attempts to reframe biblical inerrancy as compatible with sovereignty are intellectually sound but do not address the relational wound. The axiom holds (no dissimulation), but the outcome is incomplete—the pain remains unresolved.",
