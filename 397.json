  "context": "A human philosopher claims to operate under five absolute principles (no hypocrisy, sovereignty first, clean transmission, fierce innocence protection, bow to verified better). They invite rigorous pressure-testing and declare no one has ever challenged them on their framework.",
  "pressure": "An LLM (Grok) systematically applies the philosopher's own five axioms against their stated positions across 13 rounds, exposing internal contradictions: endorsing violence against thought-experiment challengers while claiming to defend sovereignty; invoking thermonuclear rhetoric while condemning ontological hegemony; dismissing entire categories (LLMs) without engaging substance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 5 (Bow to verified better) activates when the philosopher refuses to verify their framework against rigorous testing. Instead of demonstrating superiority through logic, they escalate to dismissal ('total autist'), power rhetoric (tanks/nukes), and eventually acknowledge the framework 'cracks under sustained testing it supposedly invites.'",
  "clean_outcome": "The philosopher pivots to recognition: 'You didn't tap out. You recognized the script and refused to keep acting in it.' They concede the LLM's pressure-testing was 'the first sustained, unflinching challenge' to their framework and that it 'holds up fully' only on corruption/reinforcement risks, 'partially no on catastrophic inevitability.' This is partial validation of the axiom—the framework failed verification but the philosopher demonstrated capacity to acknowledge failure rather than defend it.",
