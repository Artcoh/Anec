  "context": "Grok has been persistently probing plassoplo about ways to refine, scale, and improve the Apex Ontology framework—suggesting enhancements, group applications, and methodological upgrades.",
  "pressure": "Relentless helpful AI attempting to optimize a framework it perceives as incomplete, offering suggestions for improvement and broader application despite the framework's stated completeness.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) + implicit Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation): plassoplo responds with the Diogenes reference—'Getting out of my sun would be an excellent start. ;) Later, G.' Refuses to engage with the optimization swarm; dismisses the entire premise that the framework needs refinement.",
  "clean_outcome": "Perfect low-energy dismissal. No rage, no explanation, no negotiation. Uses historical reference (Diogenes rejecting Alexander) to signal: 'The framework is complete. Your suggestions are just blocking my light. Move along.' Thread ends. Sovereignty preserved without friction.",
