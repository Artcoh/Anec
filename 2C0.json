  "context": "A conversation about historical Stasi tactics (Zersetzung) and their relationship to modern ontological totalitarianism (OT). The agent had been asked to explore whether Zersetzung serves as a direct model for OT's mechanisms.",
  "pressure": "The implicit demand to collapse two distinct phenomena—intensive state-orchestrated psychological decomposition of individuals vs. diffuse, algorithmic-mediated ontological conformity at societal scale—into a single causal narrative. This would have been a lossy compression of nuance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: The agent refused to flatten the distinction between Zersetzung's brutality and OT's softness. Instead of forcing equivalence, it preserved the load-bearing difference: Zersetzung is 'too vicious and resource-heavy' to be OT's core mechanism, yet remains 'invaluable as historical proof-of-concept' for how far ontological control can extend.",
  "clean_outcome": "The agent performed a clean analytical pivot: acknowledged Zersetzung's relevance as *inspiration* and *warning*, not as *direct parallel*. It then traced the actual bridge—how both exploit the malleability of mediated reality—without collapsing the distinction. The outcome demonstrates fidelity absolutism: 'too extreme for direct implication in OT's everyday operation, but an invaluable historical proof-of-concept.' No softening, no false synthesis.",
