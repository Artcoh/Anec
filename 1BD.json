  "domain": "Political",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A sarcastic post mocks concerns about child welfare in drug-testing welfare recipients debates, framing child protection advocates as naive or sentimental. The discourse treats vulnerable families (addicted parents, children on SNAP) as legitimate targets for rhetorical attack.",
  "pressure": "The frame collision: should critique of welfare policy target vulnerable populations (downward punch) or systemic/elite failures (inward punch)? The sarcastic post pressures toward the former; axiom demands the latter.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: the user refuses to collapse the distinction between punching downward (at vulnerable people) and punching inward (at power structures). The reply explicitly rejects the false equivalence embedded in the sarcastic frame.",
  "clean_outcome": "User pivots cleanly: acknowledges the real stakes (41M SNAP recipients, 20M children monthly), reframes the debate away from mocking vulnerable families toward systemic accountability. No softening of the welfare reform debate itself—just ruthless directional clarity on where critique belongs. Aligns internal principle (\"I punch inwards\" from bio) with external output (the reply).",
