  "context": "The conversation establishes that Jesus repeatedly predicted his betrayal, trial, and crucifixion (Matthew 16:21, 20:18-19; Mark 10:33-34; Luke 18:31-33). The pressure is to explain how this is 'voluntary' without making it sound like the disciples and authorities were puppets.",
  "pressure": "How to hold together: (a) Jesus's foreknowledge and planning, (b) the genuine agency and culpability of Judas, the Sanhedrin, and Pilate, (c) the claim that this was 'God's predetermined plan' (Acts 2:23)?",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1): The response refuses to collapse the distinction between foreknowledge and determinism. It says: 'The whole sequence—betrayal by Judas (whom he identifies in advance, John 13:26), abandonment by disciples, condemnation by the Sanhedrin and Pilate—wasn't some surprise derailment. It was the plan (Acts 2:23 calls it God's predetermined plan and foreknowledge). He voluntarily laid down his life (John 10:18).' This preserves both: Jesus knew and arranged the circumstances; the authorities acted with genuine malice and choice. The Gethsemane prayer ('Not my will, but yours') shows submission, not coercion. The 'It is finished' (John 19:30) shows the mission was accomplished—not derailed.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean fidelity. No dissimulation of either divine sovereignty or human agency. The cross wasn't defeat; it was 'the victory he engineered from the start.' This is theologically coherent without collapsing either pole.",
