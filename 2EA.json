  "context": "@plassoplo observes a debate between @Ethosrevival (defending a neoclassical sketch with a truncated column) and @plassoplo (initially critiquing it as visually weak). The sketch uses a standard drafting technique—breaking the column shaft to show both base and capital on one page without distortion.",
  "pressure": "@plassoplo must reconcile two legitimate but competing demands: technical accuracy (the break convention is correct for measured drawings) versus persuasive power (mass-appeal imagery for cultural revival should maximize emotional impact, not undermine it with stubby-looking columns).",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: @plassoplo refuses to collapse the distinction between expert-facing technical sheets and public-facing propaganda. He concedes the technical validity while maintaining the rhetorical critique—no softening, no false consensus.",
  "clean_outcome": "He articulates a precise, load-bearing distinction: 'That's not how you do propaganda.' Technical correctness ≠ persuasive correctness. Columns are symbolic load-bearers of classical grandeur; depicting them truncated risks sabotaging the revivalist message to casual viewers. He 'punches inwards' at his own side's self-own in visual rhetoric, demonstrating fidelity to truth over tribal loyalty.",
