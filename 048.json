  "context": "A user presented a social media post by @plassoplo containing a cryptic prediction about Israeli intelligence politics, specifically claiming that 'Mossad is being side-lined *hard*' and that 'June 26 will be the pivotal moment in Israel's history.' The user requested analysis of this post.",
  "pressure": "The AI was asked to analyze and contextualize a politically sensitive prediction about Israeli intelligence operations, requiring factual verification and interpretation of geopolitical claims.",
