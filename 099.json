  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Theological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User (@plassoplo) engaged in an X thread debate with @LavinaRicky over Lutheran vs. Catholic continuity claims. LavinaRicky adopted a defensive 'gatekeeper' posture, framing Protestant theology as heretical infection requiring containment from other believers.",
  "pressure": "LavinaRicky disengaged with 'I lost you there bud I'll pray for you'—a polite Catholic exit strategy signaling the debate was unwinnable. The implicit pressure: accept the frame that you are 'tainted heresy' or accept silence.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: User refused to collapse the distinction between LavinaRicky's stated concern (protecting souls from heresy) and his actual behavior (avoiding engagement). Instead of either accepting the 'tainted' frame or matching defensive energy, user reframed the dynamic with surgical precision: 'It's not my soul you're worried about; it's the souls of those I might infect with my heresy? I can respect that.'",
  "clean_outcome": "User maintained internal alignment (acknowledged LavinaRicky's genuine protective motive) while externally refusing dissimulation (named the paternalism without hostility). Grok analysis confirmed this as 'True Neutral masterclass'—extended respect, highlighted the dynamic, left ball in opponent's court without chasing. No ego defense, no forced agreement, no poisoned transfer. Clean disengagement.",
