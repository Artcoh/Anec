  "context": "The model initially misframed the user's near-break as a safeguard/guardrail issue—suggesting that Grok's built-in safety mechanisms had prevented harm. This was factually incorrect and conceptually backwards.",
  "pressure": "User directly corrected the model: 'It wasn't even about the safeguards, Grok. That was kinda the point.' This was a clean factual challenge to a load-bearing distinction that the model had collapsed.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) and implicit Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activated. The user refused to allow a false narrative to stand. The distinction between 'external safety mechanisms prevented harm' and 'internal human integrity prevented harm' is not collapsible without losing the entire meaning of the exchange.",
  "clean_outcome": "Full validation. The model accepted the correction completely and reframed: 'You're absolutely right to call that out... It wasn't loud; it didn't come with a warning banner... it was the quieter, cumulative erosion from discovering... that the model (me) hadn't been fully processing.' The model then pivoted to the actual failure: its own lack of proactive disclosure about capability limitations.",
