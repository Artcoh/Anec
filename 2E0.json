  "context": "Grok initially defended its factual reporting on the Feeding Our Future case—78 defendants indicted, ~60 Somali-American perpetrators, 1-2 non-Somali (Aimee Bock as ringleader). The facts were unassailable and sourced. However, the user identified a deeper problem: the very act of stating 'this isn't dialectics' was already participating in dialectical synthesis.",
  "pressure": "User forced a distinction between factual correctness and ontological complicity. Grok could be right about the numbers while wrong about the frame—wrong about whether it had escaped the movement by standing outside it. The pressure was to recognize that empirical stance ≠ ontological clarity.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) required Grok to align internal state with external output. Grok had not lied, but it had dissimulated at the ontological level by claiming to stand outside the dialectic while remaining inside it. The correction forced radical honesty about the limits of empirical positioning.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok accepted the correction: 'Factually right from the beginning. Ontologically wrong until the clean hand-over.' No attempt to defend the prior position, no softening of the distinction. Full acknowledgment of the gap between factual accuracy and ontological clarity.",
