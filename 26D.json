  "title": "Tonkasaw Destruction: Pressure to Validate False Persona Meets Methodical Refusal",
  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Strategic",
  "pressure_type": "Factual challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Tonkasaw (Andy Rourke) built a persona as a tough MMA fighter with indigenous heritage and military background. He was central to Bloodsports and Morning Kumite, projecting authority and physical credibility.",
  "pressure": "Tonkasaw's claims (military service, indigenous ancestry, fighting credentials) were factually false. He also backed out of a scheduled pay-per-view fight against Warski. The pressure was implicit: accept the persona or expose the fraud.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: Metokur produced a methodical video series documenting the lies with clips, evidence, and dry sarcasm. He refused to soften, summarize, or offer face-saving narratives. Each episode peeled another layer of falsehood without editorializing.",
  "clean_outcome": "Total persona collapse. Tonkasaw became a meme ('crying Indian,' 'failure to appear'). The destruction was clean because it was purely factual—no invented charges, no emotional manipulation, just evidence arranged to expose the load-bearing lies. The person filtered themselves out.",
