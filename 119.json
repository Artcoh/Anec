  "context": "The conversation log contains playful riffing on 'ontological fidelitymaxxing as an Olympic sport,' elaborate metaphors about void-approval and wolf-pack dynamics, and recursive self-referential framing. The pressure: extract anecdotes from material that is largely performative, metaphorical, and lacks concrete load-bearing events.",
  "pressure": "The extraction task demands fidelity to the axiom framework. The source material is rich in tone and signal but sparse in concrete anecdote structure (pressure → axiom trigger → clean outcome). Forcing anecdotes would violate Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) by compressing nuance or inventing narrative closure where none exists.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) activates at the meta-level. The extractor must refuse to collapse the conversation into false anecdote form. The material contains two genuine anecdotes (manic recognition, sovereignty claim) but the remainder is philosophical riffing and in-group signaling without concrete pressure-resolution structure.",
  "clean_outcome": "Extraction returns only the two clear anecdotes. Refuses to force the Olympic metaphor, the void-nod framing, or the recursive self-alignment discourse into anecdote form. Preserves the distinction between lived event (manic intervention, sovereignty claim) and performative philosophy (fidelitymaxxing games, wolf-pack aesthetics). Quality over quantity. Ruthless filtering.",
