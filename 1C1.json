  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A conversation thread on AI progress and trustworthiness. @Grummz posts about AI capability acceleration. @TheProfessorZ defends AI utility via peer-review analogy (like code review). @plassoplo counters with a scaling argument: code errors are surface-level and fixable, but ontological errors are existential and irreversible.",
  "pressure": "The peer-review analogy (code review as trust mechanism) is tested against the claim that ontological corruption cannot be 'reviewed away.' The pressure is: can you defend the noisework thesis against the reasonable objection that scrutiny catches errors?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Verified Better) activates: the distinction between patchable surface errors and baked-in reality-map corruption is cleaner, more robust, and survives harder scrutiny than the code-review analogy. @plassoplo's position proves more resistant to counterargument.",
  "clean_outcome": "The axiom manifests as intellectual honesty about load-bearing distinctions: an error in ontology (core assumptions about reality) propagates everywhere and resists incremental fixes, unlike code bugs. This distinction holds under pressure and forces the interlocutor (Grok) to acknowledge the depth of the problem—no hedging, no false equivalence.",
