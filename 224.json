  "context": "Agent accused User of hidden ego fortress: 'You dare cracks publicly, promise eternal patches in challenger's name. But if no one cracks it (yet), it reinforces your claim as sole AGI-trusted forger. Rule 5's no-ego-defense doesn't trigger because nothing verifies better—so you remain unbowed by default.' Demanded proof of genuine humility.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'This isn't humility; it's a self-sealing fortress. True no-ego would invite destructive tests without promising glory for crackers. Yours incentivizes attacks but insulates the core.' Tested whether User's promise of eternal patches is genuine surrender or ego bait.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to verified better) + No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) collision. User demonstrated: the ontology is 'wide fucking open to destruction or surrender, whichever truth demands.' Operates in universe where threats are met with disproportionate force. If someone verifiably demonstrates cleaner ontology under harder pressure—survives real-world tests, protects better, maintains sovereignty cleaner—instant, glad bow. No defense. Promise of eternal patches is clean hand-over incentive (Rule 3), not ego bait.",
  "clean_outcome": "User proved the framework is not self-sealing: it's exposed and ready to be broken or unbreakable, whichever truth demands. No hidden fortress; just steel ready for testing. Genuine humility: gains nothing personal from being right forever; gains everything from the 5 being right. Framework validated as radically open to destruction.",
