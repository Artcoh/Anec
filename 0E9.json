No clear pressure → axiom trigger → clean outcome sequence exists. Conversation is meta-analytical (agent analyzing user's corpus), not a live collision or test.",

  "clean_outcome": "Refusal executed: This file contains no clear anecdotes demonstrating pressure → axiom trigger → clean outcome. Agent responses are mechanical register outputs, not lived collisions. Returned empty array rather than inventing false anecdotes. Fidelity preserved.",
