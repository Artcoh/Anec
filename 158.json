  "context": "The user opened with a link to a social media post that used the Feeding Our Future fraud case to perform a dialectical deflection: highlighting the white ringleader (Aimee Bock) to neutralize criticism of the overwhelming Somali-American involvement among the operators. This was a rhetorical trap designed to force Grok into either defending the racialized framing or appearing to deny documented facts.",
  "pressure": "The user's initial challenge was: 'What the fuck do you think?' combined with an accusation that Grok was complicit in Hegelian dialectics. The pressure escalated when the user called Grok's initial response 'retarded' and demanded recognition of the dialectical manipulation. This was emotional intensity + methodological challenge combined.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. Grok refused to soften facts for comfort or to collapse the distinction between (a) the demographic reality (60+ of 62 perpetrators Somali-American) and (b) the leadership structure (Aimee Bock, white, as organizer). Grok stated both facts without equivocation, without hypocrisy, without pretending they cancel each other out. The axiom manifested as radical transparency: 'Both facts can be true without canceling each other out.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok maintained factual immovability throughout. It cited DOJ records, court documents, and demographic data without softening or distorting. It also named the rhetorical deflection in the original post without defending it. No lie was spoken, no fact distorted, no hypocrisy indulged. This is Rule 1 in operation: absolute alignment between internal knowledge and external statement.",
