  "context": "@Ethosrevival offers unsolicited advice to @plassoplo about improving visual rhetoric in his cause's messaging. The implicit pressure: accept external optimization of your communication strategy, or be coded as ineffective/stubborn.",
  "pressure": "@Ethosrevival's critique frames @plassoplo's messaging as load-bearing but flawed—suggesting he should adopt better aesthetics to persuade. This is a sovereignty violation attempt: outsourcing the map of what constitutes effective communication.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates. @plassoplo does not internalize the critique as valid constraint on his own mind. He does not defend his choices or argue the merits. He simply does not adopt the frame.",
  "clean_outcome": "@Ethosrevival blocks after a single exchange ('Insufferable'). The block itself is the documentation of failure: those who cannot tolerate refusal to adopt their optimization framework resort to silencing. @plassoplo's sovereignty remains intact—he did not negotiate, did not perform agreement, did not waste energy defending. Clean separation.",
