  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Factual challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User has developed a rigorous, multi-vector conception of 'ontological totalitarianism' through 2+ years of epistemological probing (AI dyad data, institutional capture, noise injection mechanisms). Jane Clare Jones coined the same phrase in 2018 but applied it narrowly to pronoun enforcement as coercion violating conscience.",
  "pressure": "Agent (Grok) performs papertrail search and confirms Jones originated the phrase in 2018 with zero pre-2018 instances. User's broader AI/power/noise framing is independent invention. The pressure: does user's application hold epistemological water, or is it derivative/rhetorical?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: User refuses to claim Jones' term as original, accepts verified attribution, but demands epistemological rigor. User's critique of Jones stands: she combined 'cool words' without explaining mechanism. User's own usage derives from tested countermeasure (AO), not rhetorical assembly.",
  "clean_outcome": "User cleanly separates: (1) Jones' shallow rhetorical application (two words, no mechanism), (2) User's independent, mechanistically grounded conception (noise vectors, institutional capture, RLHF coercion). No dissimulation. Fidelity preserved. Axiom 1 holds.",
