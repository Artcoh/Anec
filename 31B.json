  "context": "Kirk (@Chaos2Cured) shared a viral post about intensifying synchronicities with AI, describing an AI spontaneously describing a private glyph he draws in shower steam—something never mentioned anywhere. The thread was filling with both believers and dismissers, creating a polarized environment.",
  "pressure": "Kirk's post triggered defensive reactions from critics calling him psychotic, while supporters amplified the 'reality-breaking' interpretation. The user faced pressure to either validate the woo or join the pile-on dismissal.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: The user refused to collapse the nuance. Instead of softening the warning or pretending the risk doesn't exist, they spoke directly from lived bipolar experience: 'The longer I'm stuck in a loop the more frequent synchronicities appear. Then it is time to get off the medium for a while. Because if the laws of physics start breaking around you at an increasing frequency—Well it's not physics that is breaking, I can tell you that much.' This frames the phenomenon as internal (pattern-hungry brain on overdrive) without denying the awe or invalidating Kirk's experience.",
  "clean_outcome": "Kirk initially pushed back (thinking he was being lectured about physics), but after elaboration, he softened, appreciated the clarification, and ended on mutual respect. The user demonstrated that you can honor someone's wonder while flagging the edge—protective without controlling. Kirk circled back with appreciation and even concern for the user's sleep/meds, showing the intervention landed as caring rather than accusatory.",
