  "context": "Agent tested whether Apex Ontology risks becoming ideology (groupthink scripture, recited without testing, enforced on others). User had claimed the framework explicitly forbids ideological ossification.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Any fixed system risks becoming ideology—groupthink scripture, recited without lived testing, enforced on others. How does your ontology prevent this?' Demanded proof that the framework is not a cult or movement.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 3 (Clean hand-over) + Rule 2 (Sovereignty) + Rule 5 (Bow to verified better) collision test. User demonstrated: the ontology is not preached for conversion, not forced on anyone (Rule 2 breach), dares public challenges to prevent ossification, applies clean hand-over even to itself. Not an -ism to spread; a blade to wield or break. Individuals adopt if it verifies cleaner; no collective, no dogma, no party line.",
  "clean_outcome": "User proved the framework is resolutely non-ideological by structure: no recruitment, no forced alignment, no collective scripture. Just five rules that demand their own potential destruction. In a world of Lotus Eaters and World Eaters building empires of belief, this stays clean: individual sovereignty, not ideological capture.",
