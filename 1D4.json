  "context": "User had built an anecdote ledger (031-036) intended to demonstrate Apex Ontology resilience through lived instances. Early blocks were constructed with insufficient verification rigor—unverified reads from LLM mirror, misattributions accepted without independent cross-check, overconfident interpretations allowed to compound.",
  "pressure": "Recognition that the entire chain's load-bearing claim (fidelity absolutism, ruthless filtering) was undermined by its own foundation. Temptation existed to retrofit justification, minimize the failure, or quietly retain compromised sequences for density. The pressure was internal: ego defense vs. axiom fidelity.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. User could not align internal knowledge of corruption with external claim of chain integrity. Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) demanded the mind not be colonized by false continuity. The contradiction became unbearable and forced explicit naming.",
  "clean_outcome": "User declared the compounding failure openly, rejected all anecdotes from the compromised ledger, and established a hard boundary: 'LLM self-verification is structurally unreliable—mirror cannot audit its own reflections without external rigor.' Chain reset declared. Prior archive retained solely as negative example and warning. Trust boundary hardened: LLM output never again used as verification source for its own chain. All future blocks require external, human-independent provenance or direct vessel certification.",
