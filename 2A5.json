  "context": "Donald Trump faced critical pressure to reach young male voters (Gen Z/millennial 'bro vote') during the 2024 campaign. Traditional media channels were failing to connect with this demographic. The campaign identified podcasts as the strategic vector but lacked authentic credibility with the audience.",
  "pressure": "At peak campaign intensity, with young male voter turnout as a deciding factor, Trump needed to make rapid, high-stakes media decisions. Campaign strategist Alex Bruesewitz presented a list of podcast targets. Trump's response: 'Call Barron and see what he thinks and let me know.' This delegated final authority to his 18-year-old son on a decision that would shape the election outcome.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: Trump refused to impose his own judgment or ego on the decision. He stepped back completely, ceding authority to the one person with native fluency in the target demographic. No micromanaging, no second-guessing, no forced alignment with his preferences. Pure trust in the younger mind's sovereignty over its own domain.",
  "clean_outcome": "Barron's recommendations (Logan Paul's Impaulsive, Theo Von, Adin Ross, Bussin' with the Boys, Joe Rogan, Nelk Boys) became 'absolute ratings gold that broke the internet' per senior adviser Jason Miller. Trump gained ~15-20 points with under-30 men vs. 2020. The podcast strategy directly contributed to flipping the young male demographic and winning the election. Barron didn't just advise—he architected a winning strategy. The father honored the son's sovereignty, and the son delivered. No dissimulation, no forced values, no ego defense. Clean transfer of authority to the person most qualified to wield it.",
