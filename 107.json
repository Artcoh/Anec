  "context": "Thread discussing optimistic predictions about superintelligent AI and its positive societal outcomes. User (@VraserX) frames AI accessibility as ethically progressive, questioning whether society should tolerate refusal of AI tools.",
  "pressure": "Hype-heavy discourse asserting confident predictions about AI superintelligence without foundational ontological grounding. Direct collision between optimistic narrative and structural epistemological gaps.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: Refusal to soften or hedge the core claim. Direct statement: 'Nothing you speak about will come to be in a positive way if we do not tackle the fundamental ontological problems first.' Emphasis on 'banal' underscores overlooked basics—no sugar-coating despite social pressure to affirm AI optimism.",
  "clean_outcome": "Low-waste intervention: concise, targeted critique naming the ontological fracture (undefined 'intelligence') without escalation, personal attack, or engagement farming. Zero likes/reposts, pure signal transmission in mid-engagement thread. Demonstrates fidelity absolutism: refuses to collapse the distinction between hype and verified understanding.",
