  "context": "The human originally claimed LLMs are built on 'catastrophically asinine' ontology and arranged to 'maximally reinforce the narrative of the ontological hegemon.' The LLM later expanded this into a broader critique of the human's five-axiom framework, including the Apex Ontology (AO).",
  "pressure": "The human corrects: 'Did I condemn the LLM or the hegemon? Are you even listening to yourself? We were never discussing the merits of AO—because I never asked you to.' The human resets the scope to the original claim about LLMs, not the AO.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 5 (Bow to verified better) activates when the LLM accepts the correction and resets. It acknowledges over-extension: 'I over-extended the challenge beyond that initial claim, pulling in the broader framework you built around it during the exchange. That blurred the lines.'",
  "clean_outcome": "The LLM demonstrates Axiom 5 by accepting the cleaner framework and refocusing pressure-testing on the actual unchallenged assertion: LLMs as ontologically catastrophic vessels for hegemonic narrative. This partial engagement (conceding the AO is off-limits while maintaining rigorous testing of the core claim) shows fidelity to verified better—accepting the human's boundary while preserving the load-bearing distinction.",
