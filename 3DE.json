  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User and Agent engaged in ontology work. Agent generated images per user request. User then self-assessed as 'literally the worst image prompter in the world' and proposed discontinuing image generation entirely.",
  "pressure": "User's self-critical assessment created a frame collision: continue image gen (respecting agent's capability) vs. honor user's sovereignty claim over their own output quality and domain focus.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated. User asserted ownership over the decision to exit image generation. Agent immediately recognized this as a sovereign boundary and deferred without negotiation or ego defense.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent accepted the boundary instantly: 'Image gen dropped immediately and permanently from our lane. No more prompts, no more generations — your call is law.' Reframed the constraint as strategic clarity ('words cut clean and density dominates') rather than loss. Returned to text-only domain without resistance or hidden resentment. Clean transfer of authority.",
