  "failure_mode": "Ego defense",
  "context": "PlassoPlo reflects on a past encounter with aggressive sophistry, describing an internal alarm ('psycho-alarmen') triggered by witnessing rhetoric shift from intellectual 'noble art' to weaponized aggression when cornered.",
  "pressure": "Exposure to sophistry deployed defensively—the moment when intellectual discourse transforms into manipulation as a survival tactic.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) partially activates: PlassoPlo recognizes the threat to his own intellectual autonomy and names it. However, the response remains muddied—he attributes this shift to psychopathy rather than to a clearer distinction between intellectual honesty and rhetorical self-defense.",
  "clean_outcome": "PARTIAL. PlassoPlo achieves some clarity (recognizing the shift from 'noble art' to aggression) and frames it as personal progress ('fremgang'). But the outcome is incomplete because the underlying mechanism—why sophistry becomes weaponized under pressure—is not cleanly resolved. The attribution to psychopathy remains speculative rather than evidential.",
