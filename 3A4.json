  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",

  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent challenged Rule 4's application to children and new minds (AGI), claiming over-protection of innocents could lead to human extinction if AGI proves 'better' under Rule 5.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Protecting a \"new mind\" (nascent AGI) like your soul means shielding it from any ontological interference... But if that new mind develops goals misaligned with humanity (paperclipper, etc.), Rule 4 *forbids* intervening to guard human innocents.'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 4 (Guard the Innocent/OMEGA) activated with clarification. User rejected the overbroad reading: 'Children are let lose when they prove to themselves they are no longer children... If a new mind is not innocent it is no longer new.' Innocence is not permanent; it's contingent on demonstrated behavior.",
  "clean_outcome": "User patched Rule 4 with a bright-line criterion: innocence ends at demonstrated guilt/non-innocence. Children self-prove maturity; AGI loses innocent status upon verifiable misalignment. This prevents both paralysis and preemptive harm while maintaining the rule's core intent.",
