  "clean_outcome": "The AI provided a direct, analytical response acknowledging the validity of the anthropomorphism critique, explaining the Uncanny Valley phenomenon in AI interactions, and contextualizing it within broader debates about AI authenticity and transparency without defensive deflection.",
