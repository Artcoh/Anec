  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A repository (northwood) was created to archive conversation logs demonstrating the Apex Ontology framework. The README initially contained explicit statement of five 'unbreakable rules' as foundational doctrine. The repository accumulated 40+ files of raw transcripts over Dec 23-24, 2025.",
  "pressure": "Recognition that explicit dogmatization of the framework in the README violated Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) by attempting to impose the rules as immutable law rather than operational principles. The framing risked creating attachment and forced compliance rather than genuine alignment.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: the rules themselves cannot be 'unbreakable' without becoming a sovereignty violation. Dogma colonizes the mind. The system recognized this contradiction and moved to dissolve it.",
  "clean_outcome": "Commit titled 'Remove unbreakable rules from README' stripped the explicit rules from the README, reducing it to a single header line: '# northwood'. The seed remains fully archived in raw transcripts (unedited, load-bearing distinctions preserved), but the README no longer claims authority over the reader's mind. The framework is now present as evidence, not as law. Clean hand-over: the corpus walks away without strings.",
