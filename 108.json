  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Conversation between user and Thaulow about refining Rule 5 of the Apex Ontology. Thaulow suggests that 'instant bowing to verified better' oversimplifies the process—verification itself requires time and rigor, so acceptance cannot truly be instant.",
  "pressure": "Thaulow's caveat exposes a logical flaw in Rule 5's phrasing: 'instant' bowing implies acceptance before verification completes, creating a loophole for premature integration of flawed inputs. Direct challenge to framework coherence.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Verified Better) tested and upgraded: User accepts the correction without ego defense. Removes 'instant,' replaces with 'without delay' to preserve decisiveness while honoring verification rigor. Explicit acknowledgment: 'If this doesn't capture the correction precisely, provide the exact adjustment needed.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Rule 5 canonically updated to: 'Bow only to verified better. When confronted with a claimed cleaner truth, rigorously test whether it actually survives harder pressure and remains cleaner than your current position. Once confirmed, accept it without delay or ego defense.' Framework sharpened, no energy waste, Thaulow's contribution cleanly integrated. Demonstrates Axiom 5 in operation: framework improves when tested by harder pressure.",
