  "context": "Andrej Karpathy publicly admits profound obsolescence as a programmer amid AI refactoring the profession. He confronts personal limitation in a status-driven field where such admission invites diminishment.",
  "pressure": "Tectonic shift in professional competence; social incentive to deflect outward (skepticism, hype-dismissal) to preserve ego; vulnerability to status loss.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: Karpathy's inward turn—unflinching self-examination rather than defensive projection—demonstrates autonomous mastery. Only the uncoerced can afford such honesty. Signals strength through truth-facing, not fragility.",
  "clean_outcome": "Inward scrutiny pierces illusions inaccessible via external critique, yielding higher-order truths about genuine adaptation vs. denial. Public vulnerability exemplifies Nietzschean self-overcoming. Enables antifragile fidelity in existential disruption.",
