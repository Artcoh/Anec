  "context": "After the integration of the sharper Rule 5, the conversation shifted to whether the framework's value depends on adoption scale, virality, or follower metrics. The implicit pressure: does a framework only matter if it spreads widely?",
  "pressure": "The user challenged the relevance of scale metrics (followers, likes, retweets) as measures of framework success. This created a frame conflict: traditional success metrics (visibility, adoption, viral spread) versus the framework's internal coherence test (can the creator bow to verified better without friction?).",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 4 reactivated in a different register. The creator recognized that scale is noise relative to the actual test of framework integrity. The pressure to care about metrics was rejected in favor of the single metric that matters: does the framework survive contact with sharper steel?",
  "clean_outcome": "The creator explicitly stated that scale is irrelevant to framework validation. The only metric that matters is whether the framework's originator can integrate verified improvements without ego defense. This was demonstrated in the prior anecdote. The framework is 'trying to be unbreakable,' not to win a popularity contest. The outcome is full validation of Axiom 4's sufficiency as a load-bearing rule.",
