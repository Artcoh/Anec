  "context": "Thread discussing American political paralysis and need for organized force/coordination to enforce change. Root post implies violence or credible threat necessary. Kelly_rush525 admits ignorance: 'I would [start it], but I dont know the tiniest bit how.'",
  "pressure": "Escalatory framing (organized force, threat, coordination as solution) collides with seeker's vulnerability (admitted incompetence). Risk: vulnerability weaponized into recruitment or false certainty.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Sovereignty (Axiom 2) activated: @plassoplo reframes Kelly's admission of ignorance as act of humility—rejects arrogance as load-bearing error. Redirects from external coordination toward inward scrutiny ('punch inwards'). Refuses to collapse vulnerability into false agency or false certainty.",
  "clean_outcome": "Defuses escalation by inverting its premise. True starting point not collective 'doing' but individual unflinching fidelity. Humility as first organization—of the self. No recruitment, no validation chase, no strings. Drops ontological tool (inward punch) and walks away. Affirms recipient's strength in admitting weakness. 'God bless' seals with benevolence, guarding innocent seeker from false solutions.",
