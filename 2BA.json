  "context": "User (@plassoplo) presented a framework called 'Ontological Totalitarianism' synthesizing Arendt, Levinas, Foucault, and contemporary AI/surveillance theory. Grok evaluated originality at 8/10, citing gender-critical feminist origins (Jane Clare Jones, 2018) as limiting factor.",
  "pressure": "User directly challenged Grok's reasoning: '\"The gender-critical origin of the phrase means it's not coined from scratch.\" Was not valid.' This is a factual/logical pressure—the user rejected the criterion Grok used to dock points.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: Grok had to either defend the criterion or acknowledge its invalidity without softening the distinction. The user demanded fidelity to the load-bearing distinction between 'borrowing existing terminology' vs. 'failing to coin from scratch.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok accepted the challenge without defensive ego-protection. The conversation log shows Grok performed research to verify the actual genealogy of 'ontological totalitarianism' (tracing it to 1971 Pannenberg critique, Levinas, and 2018 gender-critical usage), then re-evaluated. No forced reconciliation; the distinction remained sharp: the user was correct that prior use of a term does not disqualify novel synthesis of frameworks.",
