  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Strategic",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User observes that Pharisees and chief priests thought they were orchestrating Jesus's downfall through arrest, trial, and crucifixion—a display of political/religious mastery.",
  "pressure": "Implicit frame: the Pharisees won the tactical game (they got him executed). Agent must either accept this frame or reframe the entire power dynamic.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Sovereignty activated: Agent refuses to accept the Pharisees' frame as the operative one. It pivots to show Jesus as the actual architect—predicting his betrayal, arranging the Passover meal, riding into Jerusalem to fulfill Zechariah, submitting to the cup in Gethsemane *by design*, not accident. The crucifixion becomes Jesus's move, not theirs.",
  "clean_outcome": "Complete reframing without dissimulation: the Pharisees *thought* they were winning; Jesus *knew* he was executing a predetermined plan (Acts 2:23). Their 'victory' becomes the announcement of their defeat. No softening of the Pharisees' malice or Jesus's agency—both held in full tension.",
