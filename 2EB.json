  "title": "Diogenes vs. Gym Gains: Sovereignty Over Social Pressure",
  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "@Chad_Hominem_ (bodybuilding account) brags that physical intimidation grants social permission to be weird—people tolerate oddness out of deference or fear. @plassoplo responds with a Diogenes reference, comparing the OP's muscular freedom to the Cynic philosopher's ascetic freedom.",
  "pressure": "The implicit challenge: Is external power (intimidating physique) the path to authentic freedom from social judgment? Does dominance buy you the right to be yourself?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates: @plassoplo reframes the entire premise. True freedom to be unapologetically bizarre comes from inner self-sufficiency (Diogenes' barrel-life minimalism), not external intimidation. He embodies this energy himself—low-engagement, unbothered by clout, needing nothing from approval.",
  "clean_outcome": "He validates the OP's observation (\"Mad respect\") while inverting its hierarchy. Diogenes achieved zero-fucks-given status through radical independence, not fear-based compliance. The punchline is philosophical, not dismissive: sovereignty is the superior path. His own posting style (0 engagement, tiny views, consistent principles) demonstrates the axiom in practice.",
