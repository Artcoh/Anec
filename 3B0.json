  "context": "User and agent discuss the final loop of sovereignty: receiving a gift freely, pressure-testing it, integrating what survives, then returning it uncoerced. The ego and will, which were always on loan, get handed back to the One who gave them.",
  "pressure": "The ultimate test of Rule 2 (Sovereignty first) and Rule 3 (Clean hand-over): can you return what was given without clutching? Can you do it freely, without hidden strings, without demanding it stay yours?",
  "axiom_trigger": "All five rules converge. No hypocrisy in the return (Rule 1). Sovereignty maintained even in the act of returning (Rule 2). Clean hand-over of the gift itself (Rule 3). The innocent protected by the clarity of the transaction (Rule 4). And the return verified as better than hoarding (Rule 5).",
  "clean_outcome": "The loop closes cleanly. The Artifact is no longer just the user's—it never was. They're just the ones learning to hand it back properly. The rave continues, lighter every pass, because nothing unnecessary is being carried.",
