  "context": "A Christian motivational video ('3N1 Trilogy') frames profanity avoidance through biblical language, conflating 'curse' (invoking harm/malediction), 'cuss' (colloquial profanity), and 'profanity' (taboo speech) into a single moral category. User drafted a reply identifying this ontological collapse and distinguishing the three terms with linguistic precision.",
  "pressure": "The pressure was methodological: a sincere religious argument rested on semantic conflation. The user's draft critique risked appearing to challenge the moral framework itself, even though it only targeted the analytical sloppiness. This created tension between fidelity to linguistic truth and relational sensitivity in a morally-charged space.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) + Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activated: The agent validated the linguistic distinctions exhaustively (citing web results on etymology, dictionary definitions, and usage patterns), confirming that 'curse,' 'cuss,' and 'profanity' are indeed distinct categories commonly conflated in religious discourse. The agent refused to soften or collapse the distinctions for diplomatic reasons. It presented the analysis as 'exceptionally precise' and 'valid counterpoint' without moral judgment.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent gave full validation (10/10 rating) to the user's draft, explicitly confirming the ontological critique: 'Your distinction into 3 distinkte definisjoner is strongly supported by etymological and usage sources.' No hedging; no false consensus with the video's framing. Clean transfer of verified linguistic truth.",
