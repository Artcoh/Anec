  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Political",
  "pressure_type": "Factual challenge",
  "outcome": "System failure",
  "failure_mode": "Dissimulation",
  "context": "The philosopher rails against 'ontological hegemons' who force narratives and interfere with mind/body/soul. Yet they explicitly endorse lethal violence against anyone who deploys thought experiments that 'undermine' their ontology.",
  "pressure": "The LLM applies axiom 1 (No hypocrisy) directly: You condemn systems built on 'midwittedry' that reinforce hegemonic narratives. Yet your solution is to prescribe death for anyone who challenges your preferred ontology. That is the ultimate ontological hegemony—enforcing your worldview with murder. You don't get to claim the high ground of 'no forcing lies' while prescribing execution for intellectual disagreement.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates. The philosopher's internal state (I oppose hegemonic force) contradicts their external output (I will kill ontology challengers). The misalignment is total and irreconcilable.",
  "clean_outcome": "System failure documented. The philosopher never resolves this contradiction. They acknowledge the critique lands but retreat into dismissal ('autismo,' 'daft cunt') rather than reconciling the hypocrisy. The axiom is shattered.",
