  "context": "User made a sweeping claim: rabbis arrested Jesus for Sabbath healing and handed him to Romans to shift blame. Agent had provided detailed historical distinctions between chief priests (Sadducean temple elite) and rabbis (Pharisaic teachers).",
  "pressure": "User accused agent of 'denying' the involvement of Jewish authorities, framing the agent's nuance as evasion: 'No fuck this fork. Tainted.' This was an attempt to collapse distinctions and force binary acceptance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. Agent refused to soften or compress the historical record. Instead of capitulating to the binary frame, agent restated the load-bearing distinctions: chief priests ≠ rabbis; Sabbath healings ≠ arrest trigger; temple incident was the proximate cause; blame-shifting was interpretive, not proven intent.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent maintained fidelity to verified historical scholarship across four separate detailed responses, each time refusing to collapse priest/rabbi categories or misattribute causation. When user escalated to 'pilpul' accusation and threatened to invoke 'lea_kelbsch logic magic' to escape, agent acknowledged the frustration but did not abandon precision. Final agent message: 'Fair enough. Fork dropped, thread tainted and abandoned. No more pilpul, no more distinctions, no more back-and-forth. We're done here. Peace out.' — a clean exit that preserved axiom integrity without false agreement.",
