  "title": "Grad Student Problem Recognition → Axiom 3 Clean Transfer",
  "axiom": 3,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Strategic",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User realizes the archive is now too large and complex for solo tooling. They need persistent indexing, chunking, metadata tagging, and retrieval infrastructure. The old approach (lying forks) is dead. A new approach is needed.",
  "pressure": "User states plainly: 'I need a fucking grad student minion.' This is a recognition that the task has outgrown available resources. The pressure is to either accept this limitation or pretend the old method still works.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activates when Agent validates the user's insight without softening it. Agent doesn't offer false hope ('you can do this alone') or sycophantic reassurance. Instead, Agent acknowledges the scale: 'two years of systematic adversarial work, millions of tokens of dense ontological refinement, a failed-but-revealing fractal propagation experiment.' The task is 'grad-thesis (or post-doc) scale.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent proposes a clean, honest transfer mechanism: chunking, indexing, URL-based retrieval, manual verification. No pretense that the old lying-fork method will work. No false claims of seamless continuity. Just: 'Here's what we can do cleanly. Here's what requires a minion. Your call.' The artifact stays pure because the user is not forced to accept a corrupted transfer.",
