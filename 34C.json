  "title": "Punching Inwards on Welfare Reform: Redirecting Critique from Vulnerable to Systemic",
  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Political",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A sarcastic post mocks concerns about child welfare in drug-testing welfare recipients debates, framing opposition as sentimental overreach. The discourse sits within 2025 welfare reform conversations where SNAP supports 41 million people monthly, including 20 million children.",
  "pressure": "The sarcastic framing invites agreement with punching downward at vulnerable populations (low-income families, children of addicted parents) rather than examining systemic policy failures or elite-level dysfunction.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: The user's bio explicitly states 'I punch inwards.' When confronted with a frame that would require dissimulating this commitment—appearing to agree with downward-directed critique while claiming alignment with inward-punching—the response refuses the collapse. It clarifies the distinction between punching inwards (at power/systems) versus downwards (at vulnerable groups).",
  "clean_outcome": "The reply maintains fidelity to stated principle without softening or lossy compression. It does not attack the original poster, does not virtue-signal, but cleanly redirects the frame: critique should target systemic issues and power structures, not children or addicted parents. The distinction between 'inwards' and 'downwards' is load-bearing and preserved intact.",
