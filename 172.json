  "context": "JD Hall crafted a closing line attacking Doug Wilson's theological position: 'Wilson's compass pointed due Talmud and called it north.' This was intended as a devastating epiphonematic summary of Wilson's alleged moral inversion.",
  "pressure": "The user's rhetorical analysis exposed the device as hyperbolic overreach—effective for tribal outrage but logically imprecise. Wilson's actual position (Talmud as 'mixed bag') was strawmanned into wholesale endorsement. The critique challenged Hall's intellectual sovereignty: was he wielding truth or demagoguery?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) partially activated. Hall's rhetorical choice to exaggerate for persuasive force represents a micro-violation of intellectual autonomy—using a sledgehammer when precision was available. The user's assessment ('not even good') forced acknowledgment that the device was effective but crude.",
  "clean_outcome": "Partial engagement. The user's analysis was incorporated into the conversation (the detailed rhetorical breakdown appears in the log), but no clean pivot to greater precision occurred. Hall's subsequent behavior (continued polemical intensity) suggests ego defense: the critique was heard but not integrated into revised practice. The sovereignty violation persists—Hall continues choosing rhetorical impact over accuracy.",
