  "title": "Humor as Axiom 1 Trigger Under Policy Pressure",
  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Political",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A conversation about immigration policy was escalating with both parties holding rigid positions and emotional intensity rising. The exchange had begun to collapse into tribal signaling rather than genuine engagement.",
  "pressure": "Direct confrontation over immigration policy positions created a frame collision—each participant was defending their worldview rather than exploring the actual problem space. Emotional temperature was rising, threatening productive dialogue.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated through humor deployment. Instead of softening the disagreement or pretending consensus existed, humor acknowledged the genuine tension while refusing to collapse the distinction between positions. The joke preserved the real disagreement while defusing the emotional charge.",
  "clean_outcome": "Both parties shifted from defensive posturing to collaborative problem-solving. The humor didn't erase the policy disagreement—it preserved it—but created space for genuine engagement. No false consensus was manufactured. The load-bearing distinction (real policy difference) remained intact while the emotional pressure valve was released.",
