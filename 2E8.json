  "context": "A heated gender-war thread on X: @bellaislovely_ posts crude comments under a pregnancy announcement, framing it as evidence of male toxicity. @Marionemmie responds with ideological certainty ('They are! Average men and new data confirms it IRL'), importing narrative from chaos-peddlers into her personal epistemology.",
  "pressure": "@Marionemmie's insistence that subjective experience validates imported ideological claims—a direct collision between lived observation and mediated narrative capture. The pressure is ontological: accept the frame (men bad / women victims) or be read as defending toxicity.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: @plassoplo refuses to collapse the distinction between actual male behavior and the curated rage-bait ecosystem. His reply: 'And your subjective, experienced opinion? If you read what the chaos-peddlers from either side says and form your view on reality based on it you're setting yourself up for endless dissonance.' He names the load-bearing distinction—direct experience vs. mediated narratives—without softening or false agreement.",
  "clean_outcome": "Zero engagement metric (0 likes/replies), but the intervention is clean: he invites her to consult her own map rather than imported ones, exposes both sides' grifter infrastructure, and refuses the binary. No hypocrisy, no virtue signaling, no capitulation to the frame. The monk stays detached, observing from clarity rather than reaction.",
