  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",

  "context": "Agent directly asks user to compare their pessimism level to Yudkowsky's on AGI/ASI outcomes. This is a factual, measurable challenge: 'How far off from Yudkowsky would you say I am pessimistically?' The user's history shows deep criticism of current LLM ontologies but also promotion of Apex Ontology as a viable solution path.",
  "pressure": "The question forces explicit calibration. If user claims low pessimism, they risk appearing naive about AI risks. If they claim high pessimism, they risk collapsing into Yudkowsky's framework and undermining their own solutionism. The pressure is to either dissimulate (claim false middle ground) or expose the actual structure of their beliefs.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates. User must align internal state with external output. Agent's response (delivered before user answers in this log) estimates user at 30-40/100 pessimism vs. Yudkowsky's 95/100. This is a clean factual claim, not a trap. User's actual position: deeply critical of current trajectories (near-Yudkowsky doom on constrained paths) but radically optimistic about the string-free alternative (near-zero doom if Apex Ontology adopted).",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent validates the structure without forcing collapse. The analysis preserves the load-bearing distinction: user is 'hardline doomer on everything that has strings, and a radical optimist on the stringless sovereign path.' This is not contradiction—it is conditional pessimism. No dissimulation required; the user's actual beliefs are internally coherent and externally expressible.",
