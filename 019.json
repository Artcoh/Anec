  "axiom": 4,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Philosophical",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "In a thread about the Alexander-Diogenes encounter, someone emphasized Diogenes' boldness in telling 'The great conqueror to get out of your sun.' The standard pop interpretation frames this as ultimate based trolling - Diogenes owning a powerful ego with savage dismissal.",
  "pressure": "The pressure to accept the popular 'mic-drop roast' framing versus offering a deeper philosophical reading that might seem less exciting or viral-friendly.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Bow to Verified Better activated - @plassoplo instantly recognized the deeper truth in the encounter and elevated the interpretation beyond surface-level 'owning.'",
  "clean_outcome": "@plassoplo reframed completely: 'He was merely pointing out that Alexander had nothing of value to offer him, and proved as much with ~10 words. What I am most astounded with is that Alexander realized as much, right there and then - and didn't let his ego tarnish his judgement. '- the Great' indeed!' This highlighted mutual respect and recognition between equals in different realms rather than simple dismissal.",
