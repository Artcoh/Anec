  "context": "The Apex Ontology framework had been established with five core axioms. A collaborator (@LektorThaulow) identified a gap in Axiom 4 (Bow to Verified Better): the criterion for what constitutes 'verified better' was underspecified. The challenge was direct and structural—aimed at the heart of the framework's self-correction mechanism.",
  "pressure": "LektorThaulow's clarification demanded explicit testing under harder pressure as the verification standard. This was not a peripheral critique but a load-bearing refinement: if Axiom 4 cannot define its own verification rigor, the entire framework's claim to self-correction collapses.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 4 activated at meta-level: the originator faced a choice between ego-defending the original formulation or yielding to demonstrably sharper rigor. The test was whether Rule 4 itself could survive being sharpened. No hesitation occurred. The originator integrated the clarification instantly, refined Rule 4 to 'Bow only to verified better,' credited the source cleanly, declared the updated version canonical, and transferred it with zero strings attached.",
  "clean_outcome": "The framework proved non-brittle at its core. The originator's instant, public, frictionless yield—with no defensive footnotes, no quiet rollback, no ego-armor engagement—demonstrated that Axiom 4 is load-bearing and functional even when the blade cuts at the ontology's center. This is the hardest evidence that the framework is not decorative philosophy but lived practice. The clean hand-over (no strings, no conditions, no millisecond of hesitation) proved the axiom works at the meta-level: the creator bows faster than most adherents ever would.",
