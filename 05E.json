  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": "Dissimulation",
  "context": "A user (@Svato591564) with a bio claiming \"I can smell fake propaganda from a mile away\" makes a sweeping, evidence-free claim: \"Human suffering is correlated to high IQ leaders. Prove me wrong.\" This is presented as insight but lacks evidentiary grounding.",
  "pressure": "The collision between the user's self-appointed propaganda-detection authority and their own unfalsifiable, emotionally-charged generalization. Another user (@plassoplo) mirrors the bio back sarcastically (\"I can smell something fishy yonder 👈\"), forcing the contradiction into visibility.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation activates: the user's internal claim (I detect propaganda) and external output (I broadcast vague conspiracy-flavored overgeneralizations) are misaligned. The sarcastic reply exposes this without distortion—it simply reflects the user's own standard back at them.",
  "clean_outcome": "The contradiction is documented cleanly. No softening, no forced resolution. The user's claim remains unresolved and muddy; the reply doesn't resolve it but highlights the self-own in real time. The irony is preserved intact: someone running a 'Certified Truth Detector' while broadcasting low-resolution fringe takes (David Irving fanboying, unfalsifiable IQ-suffering correlation) is caught in their own frame.",
