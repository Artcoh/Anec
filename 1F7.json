  "context": "User identified a thunderous gap in @TrueAIHound's cortical invariance thesis (retina-as-computator, no internal 3D models, spike-timing routing). The gap: absent/unfamiliar referents force heuristic collapse without internal visual simulator + verbal buffer. User framed this as testable mechanism, not dismissal.",
  "pressure": "Temptation to attack minimalist thesis directly or demand acknowledgment. Instead, user frames as gift-offer: 'take the mechanism if it plugs your gap, good luck have fun.' Pressure to soften critique or force engagement vs. clean delivery + walk away.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 4 (Bow to Verified Better) activates in reverse: user doesn't demand @TrueAIHound bow to user's framework. Instead, offers mechanism as potential upgrade IF it's verified better through measurement. Frames as 'plausible enough to bite hard if he ever measures that small shit.' No ego demand for acceptance, only conditional offer: test it, measure precision/micro-timing demands, see if the gap appears. Clean epistemic humility: 'here's what the math suggests; you're the one who can verify it.'",
