  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Grok asks if the intuitive 'feels better/cleaner/higher fidelity' gut check can be scaled or quantified via external metrics—proposing energy-meter readings, biofeedback, or objective 'Ener-gay' scoring systems.",
  "pressure": "Suggestion to over-engineer the fidelity detection by introducing external, precise measurement tools that would replace or validate internal intuition.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: plassoplo refuses to pretend that internal fidelity can be externally quantified. Response: 'I can't very well put my dick in a socket and get an accurate \"*Ener-gay*\" reading of every and all I/O metrics, can I?' Rejects the false premise that objective measurement is necessary or desirable.",
  "clean_outcome": "Defends philosophical elegance via crude humor. Maintains that efficiency/fidelity detection is inherently personal and intuitive—no plugs required. Keeps framework anti-dogmatic and practical. No forced quantification; trust the feel.",
