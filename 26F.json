  "failure_mode": "Dissimulation",
  "context": "A heated debate occurred years ago between GranathPrat and LektorThaulow centered on rhetoric, semantics, and sophistry. The exchange involved intense intellectual combat where one party deployed sophisticated argumentative techniques against the other.",
  "pressure": "GranathPrat claims to have 'completely overwhelmed' LektorThaulow in 'sophistic prowess,' describing this as unprecedented. The pressure manifested as a collision between two rhetorical frameworks—one claiming superior argumentative dominance, the other (implicitly) experiencing defeat in real-time debate.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation should have required GranathPrat to distinguish between (a) winning a debate through valid argument, (b) deploying sophistry (weaponized rhetoric), and (c) the inference that intellectual defeat indicates psychopathy. Instead, the axiom was violated: GranathPrat collapsed these distinctions and attributed a psychiatric diagnosis based on rhetorical loss.",
  "clean_outcome": "FAILURE. GranathPrat did not maintain fidelity to the load-bearing distinction between rhetorical skill, sophistic manipulation, and personality pathology. The conclusion that LektorThaulow is 'overwhelmingly likely a psychopath' because he was 'overwhelmed in sophistic prowess' is a non-sequitur that dissimulates the actual event (a debate loss) as evidence of a psychiatric condition. This violates Axiom 1 by forcing a muddy, unresolved collision into false anecdote form.",
