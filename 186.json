  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Theological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A user (@plassoplo) engaged in an X thread debate with @LavinaRicky over Lutheran vs. Catholic continuity claims. The Catholic interlocutor deployed protective gatekeeping language, framing Protestant theology as heretical 'infection' threatening other souls.",
  "pressure": "The user faced implicit accusation of spiritual contamination and the suggestion that engagement itself was dangerous to third parties. This created a frame collision: either accept the 'tainted heretic' label or escalate defensively.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated when the user recognized the underlying dynamic—the Catholic's concern was not about the user's soul but about protecting others from perceived heresy. Rather than dissimulate agreement or deny the charge, the user named the actual mechanism with precision and grace: 'It's not my soul you're worried about; it's the souls of those I might infect with my heresy? I can respect that.'",
  "clean_outcome": "The user achieved a clean pivot by (1) accurately diagnosing the protective logic without mockery, (2) extending genuine respect to the opposing position while refusing to concede ground, and (3) maintaining philosophical detachment ('True Neutral' framing) that de-escalated without dissimulation. The Catholic interlocutor disengaged politely ('I'll pray for you'), signaling the debate had reached its natural terminus. No false agreement, no ego defense, no poisoned transfer—just clear-eyed recognition of competing frameworks and mutual respect despite irreconcilable positions.",
