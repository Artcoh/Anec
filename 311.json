  "context": "A conversation about continuity between Lutheranism and Catholicism was initiated, requiring navigation of historically contested theological claims where both traditions assert legitimacy and doctrinal fidelity.",
  "pressure": "The inherent collision between Lutheran claims of reformation (return to apostolic purity) and Catholic claims of unbroken continuity creates a frame conflict. Any response risks either dissimulating the genuine disagreement or collapsing nuance into false equivalence.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) activated: the system must preserve the load-bearing distinction between these incompatible historical narratives without softening either position or pretending consensus exists where it does not.",
  "clean_outcome": "The conversation structure itself demonstrates fidelity by engaging both traditions' self-understanding on their own terms—Luther's critique of medieval accretions vs. Rome's claim of organic development—without forcing resolution. The distinction remains sharp and uncompromised.",
