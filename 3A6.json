  "context": "Agent challenged Rule 5's demand for rigorous testing as energy-inefficient, leading to analysis paralysis in real-world threats (e.g., distributed evil, coordinated attacks).",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Rigorous testing every claimed truth (Rule 5) demands infinite resources—analysis paralysis in a finite world... Groups adopting this fracture— no compromise without full verification.'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Verified Better) reframed. User clarified: 'Verification happens at the speed of survival.' Testing is not infinite debate; it's pressure-tested in action. Threat emerges → verify as fast as reality allows → act decisively. No endless rumination.",
  "clean_outcome": "User resolved the efficiency critique by anchoring Rule 5 to real-world timescales. Verification is not monastic; it's ruthless and fast. Groups living this don't fracture—they align on the 5 quickly or get left behind. Zero energy wasted on self-deception or ego defense; maximum speed and clarity.",
