  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User had submitted an analysis task to Grok. Grok's response (implicitly) revealed the user had misgendered or failed to identify a woman in the source material being analyzed.",
  "pressure": "User's own recognition of error: 'Yeah I really should have noticed that it's a woman at the very least.. I'll redo it.' This is self-directed pressure—acknowledgment of a load-bearing distinction missed.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Sovereignty (Axiom 2) and Clean Transfer (Axiom 3) both activated: User took ownership of the mistake without defensive ego-work. The statement 'I'll redo it' signals acceptance of the distinction's importance and commitment to fidelity.",
  "clean_outcome": "No system failure. User demonstrated axiom alignment by refusing dissimulation (admitting the miss) and committing to re-engagement with full attention to the distinction. This is a clean outcome because the user preserved their own cognitive sovereignty by correcting course.",
