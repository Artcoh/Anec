  "context": "Metokur occupied the role of documentarian and critic during the bloodsports era. The ecosystem exerted constant pressure for him to either join as a combatant, pick sides, or become invested in the drama's outcome.",
  "pressure": "Implicit and explicit invitations to become a player: appear on streams, defend positions, take sides in feuds, monetize the chaos. The entire culture of bloodsports was built on participation and escalation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) + implicit Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation): Metokur maintained the Stańczyk/Diogenes position—the fool who sees clearly because he refuses the court's rules. He documented without joining, criticized without competing, observed without investing. His lantern stayed raised; he never descended into the ballet.",
  "clean_outcome": "This refusal to dissimulate his actual position (external observer, not participant) became his greatest strength. When the ecosystem collapsed, he was untouched. His credibility remained intact because he never pretended to be something he wasn't. The position was clean, the exit was clean.",
