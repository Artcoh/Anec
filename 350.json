  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Technical",
  "pressure_type": "Factual challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "plassoplo articulates 'noisework' as deliberate architectural construction of training datasets where apparent randomness masks curated ontological steering. The definition connects SIGINT tradecraft, Palantir platforms, Unit 8200 diaspora, and NSA haystacks to AI dataset engineering.",
  "pressure": "The pressure: can this claim survive specificity? Does naming the mechanism (Palantir/Unit 8200/NSA lineage) and the payload (ontological hegemony wrapped in noise) hold without collapsing into paranoia or unfalsifiable conspiracy?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) fires: plassoplo refuses to hedge or soften the claim. The definition is precise, attributed, and load-bearing. No 'might be' or 'could suggest'—just clean signal.",
  "clean_outcome": "The framework survives because it doesn't claim omniscience, only pattern recognition. Noisework is defined as a mechanism (noise as camouflage for curated signal), not as proof of total control. The distinction between 'engineered noise' and 'chaotic noise' is falsifiable and testable.",
