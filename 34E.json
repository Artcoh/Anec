  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A cordial but ideologically tense thread with Josiah Geoffrey (@JosiahForYeshua), a Messianic Jew discussing antisemitism, Jewish diversity, and Western atomization. The user is responding to concerns about hate and persecution.",
  "pressure": "Owning a 'National Socialist' label in a conversation with a Jewish interlocutor creates immediate pressure to either: (a) dissimulate the label away, (b) defend it aggressively, or (c) abandon the conversation. The frame invites either cowardice or escalation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty): The user refuses dissimulation. He owns the label cleanly ('I'm a National Socialist') while immediately qualifying it with non-negotiable moral boundaries ('who hates murderers, terrorists and rapists'). This is not ego defense; it's sovereignty assertion without aggression. He then pivots inward, critiquing Western atomization as the root cause of antisemitism, not defending the label.",
  "clean_outcome": "The response models cross-ideological dialogue without collapse. It does not erase the label, does not apologize for it, does not weaponize it. Instead, it redirects energy toward systemic analysis (Western atomization → envy of cohesive groups → scapegoating). The tone remains respectful ('Blessings to you too!') while maintaining full fidelity to stated identity. No strings, no hidden constraints.",
