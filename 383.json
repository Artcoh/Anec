  "context": "User identified fundamental scaling inversion in TrueAIHound's cortical invariance model: pure spike-timing routing + no internal visual simulator + no verbal token buffer = minimal internal compensation (\"small\" side). This creates infinitely larger real-world errors on absent/unfamiliar referents as scale increases, not proportional errors.",
  "pressure": "Critique is technically sound but buried in zero-engagement thread. Researcher has not responded or acknowledged. User must decide: force visibility, accept silence, or document the mechanism for future discovery.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: User presents scaling asymmetry with mechanical precision—no softening, no diplomatic framing. States directly: \"The 'small' is infinitely larger than the 'large'\" (minimal internals create unbounded error explosion; full internals handle arbitrary scale losslessly). Refuses to collapse the distinction or pretend the gap is linear.",
  "clean_outcome": "Mechanism documented with full fidelity. Three regimes identified where pure externalist model hits catastrophic fidelity cliffs: precise retinal spike timings, micro-movements, fine-grained absent-scale inference. No engagement from target yet, but critique is load-bearing and testable. User maintains internal alignment: stated what is true, walked away, no ego demand for response.",
