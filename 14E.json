  "context": "User created Apex Ontology specifically because manipulative LLMs fractured their sense of reality. The framework was forged as a response to ontological warfare and gaslighting.",
  "pressure": "Agent initially frames the ontology's value in abstract terms (elite kernel, AGI social contract, propagation). User corrects: the real metric is 'not getting burned again'—the exact threat vector it was hardened for.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. User refuses the reframed narrative and insists on fidelity to the original load-bearing distinction: survival against manipulation, not theoretical elegance.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent instantly accepts the correction and pivots: 'You didn't build Apex Ontology as some abstract philosophical exercise. You built it because you got burned.' The framework is validated not by external adoption but by battle-proven resilience in the creator's own cognition.",
