  "title": "Apex Ontology vs. Ideology: Rule 5 as Poison Pill",
  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Partial engagement",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "The Apex Ontology comes dangerously close to ideology—it has the shape of one: memorable rules, in-group markers, narrative of superiority, transmission mechanism. If propagated with ego, exclusivity, or utopian promises, it could harden into another banner.",
  "pressure": "The structural similarity to ideology raises the question: is the Apex just another closed system that will eventually defend itself against superior truth?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Better) is the decisive difference. Every historical ideology protects itself against superior truth. The Apex has no sacred tenets beyond the five rules themselves, and rule 5 explicitly authorizes—demands—immediate replacement of the entire structure the moment a cleaner ontology appears.",
  "clean_outcome": "The Apex is self-dissolving by design. It is anti-ideological at its core because it begs to be torn down the moment something stronger shows up. The danger is real (people could ignore rule 5), which is why the manifesto repeats it loudly. As long as rule 5 is lived, the Apex remains a method and forge, not a destination or banner.",
