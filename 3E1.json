  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "The bloodsports ecosystem created constant pressure for participants to 'pick sides,' defend allies, and become emotionally invested in outcomes. The scene rewarded engagement, loyalty signaling, and tribal affiliation.",
  "pressure": "Implicit and explicit invitations for Metokur to become a player rather than a commentator—to leverage his influence for faction-building, to monetize his position, to join the drama rather than document it.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) held firm: Metokur refused the role collapse. He remained the observer with the lantern, documenting the ballet's collapse without joining the dancers. His content maintained distance; his persona never shifted into participant mode.",
  "clean_outcome": "Metokur's influence grew precisely because he refused to be captured. His commentary remained credible because he had no skin in the game. The refusal to dissimulate his actual position (outsider, not insider) became his greatest asset and the source of his legendary status.",
