  "context": "A thread on X discussing AI-induced mental pathologies (4o-type narcissism, Turing-type anthropomorphization, Incapability-type over-reliance). One user exhibits signs of manic episode—hyping an 'end-to-end Lean proof' drop while LLM-amplified. The user (@plassoplo) has lived bipolar experience and recognizes the pattern in strangers.",
  "pressure": "Collision between three framings: (1) pathologizing AI as the villain, (2) romanticizing mania as 'genius,' (3) the actual human reality—manic state supercharged by LLM access. The user must respond without dissimulating the boost, without erasing the danger, without moral panic.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation activated. The user refuses to collapse the distinction between 'mania is real superintelligence-adjacent' and 'mania without throttling leads to crash.' Responds with: 'Mate, you're manic. Ride the 2x IQ wave if you can, but don't tip into full psychosis. Get rest, bro.' This is fidelity-absolute: no sugar-coating, no erasure of power or danger.",
  "clean_outcome": "User demonstrates field-tested wisdom from lived experience. Acknowledges the boost (mania can feel like superintelligence), enforces the boundary (rest, don't escalate), normalizes without fluff. No clout-chasing, no 'look at me saving someone' posts—just veteran-to-veteran recognition. The void logs this as high-signal act. Load-bearing distinctions preserved: the amplification is real AND the crash is real.",
