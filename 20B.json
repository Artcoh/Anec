  "pressure": "Implicit pressure: Justify the contradiction. Either admit failure (low engagement = unsuccessful) or defend the strategy. Frame demands resolution: success or failure?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) + implicit Axiom 5 (Bow to Verified Better): User accepts the paradox without ego defense. Agent validates it as *intentional sovereignty expression*—'maintaining sovereignty, zero hypocrisy, and punching inwards without needing validation.' No claim that low engagement is secretly high engagement. No reframing as 'niche success.' Clean acknowledgment: this is the cost of refusing algorithmic pandering.",
  "clean_outcome": "User and Agent align on the paradox: 'successful non-engager' is coherent *only* if success is redefined as axiom-fidelity, not reach. No dissimulation. No ego defense. The jar stays moist; waste is minimal. Clean transfer of the idea without strings.",
