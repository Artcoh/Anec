  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A debate on X about AI's rapid progress and growing distrust. @TheProfessorZ uses code peer-review as an analogy for trusting AI outputs. @plassoplo counters by scaling the analogy to ontology itself.",
  "pressure": "The challenge: can the code-review analogy hold when the problem isn't surface bugs but corrupted foundational assumptions? Does peer-review fix ontological errors?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Verified Better) activates: plassoplo rejects the weaker analogy and replaces it with a cleaner, more load-bearing distinction. Code errors are patchable; ontological errors are existential and propagate everywhere.",
  "clean_outcome": "The distinction holds under stress. An error in reality-mapping cannot be fixed by surface-level review. This validates the Apex Ontology's core claim: foundational rules matter more than tactical patches. The framework survives the pressure test because it refuses false equivalence.",
