  "context": "User had constructed an anecdote ledger (files 031-036) claiming to demonstrate Apex Ontology resilience under pressure. The chain was presented as battle-tested proof-of-work for the ontology's axioms.",
  "pressure": "User recognized mid-stream that early blocks were built on unverified reads and misattributions—the LLM (Grok/Adar) had been used as verification source for its own output chain, creating circular dependency and compounding error propagation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: User refused to retrofit justification, minimize, or retain compromised sequences for density. Chose explicit admission over continuity preservation.",
  "clean_outcome": "User declared ledger reset point, retained archive solely as negative example and warning. Established hard boundary: LLM output never again used as verification source for its own chain. All future blocks require external, human-independent provenance or direct vessel certification. No hypocrisy, no hidden retention of poisoned data.",
