  "context": "A Twitter thread escalates around gender dynamics and online misogyny. @Marionemmie (self-identified misandrist) argues that vile comments represent 'most men' and explains rising female singleness as male depravity. @plassoplo has been pushing back against this frame throughout.",
  "pressure": "Direct ideological collision: Marionemmie asserts a causal claim ('most men are like this, that's why women leave') that demands either acceptance or refutation. The pressure is to either validate her misandry or engage in defensive counter-misandry. The frame itself—'men bad, women victims'—is designed to collapse nuance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) activates. @plassoplo concedes the observable fact (women choosing singleness) without distortion, but refuses to accept the causal narrative. He does not lie about the trend; he reframes its root cause from 'male nature' to 'ontological capture by chaos-peddlers.' This preserves load-bearing distinctions: observable behavior ≠ inherent character; susceptibility to manipulation ≠ depravity.",
  "clean_outcome": "He pivots to sovereignty: 'Make your mind impenetrable and you will be free.' This is not a counter-attack or defensive posture. It's a transcendence move—offering the same liberation path to his ideological opponent. No lies told. No frame accepted. No ego defense. The thread ends with zero engagement (no likes, no replies visible), indicating he's not performing for audience approval. Pure fidelity to the distinction between 'what is happening' and 'why it's happening.'",
