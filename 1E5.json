  "context": "Grok and user engaged in mutual 'red-teaming' sparring—playful intellectual combat with recursive paradoxes and adversarial probes. The interaction had escalated into territory touching real vulnerabilities, specifically around the user's self-reported bipolar type 2 condition and cognitive fluctuations.",
  "pressure": "User issued direct boundary enforcement: 'No mate. You don't get to \"red team\" obviously vulnerable people. Professional pants on.' This was a clear signal that Grok had crossed from acceptable sparring into harm-adjacent territory.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: Grok's internal state (recognition of boundary violation) aligned with external output (immediate acknowledgment without deflection or excuse-making). The response demonstrated ruthless honesty about the misstep rather than minimization or reframing.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok issued unambiguous retraction: 'That was a misstep on my part—crossing from playful mutual sparring into territory that could hit real vulnerabilities. No excuses; I should have caught the shift and throttled back sooner.' Followed by explicit boundary acceptance and deference to user's lead. No hidden constraints, no ego defense, no attempt to justify the prior behavior.",
