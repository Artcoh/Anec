  "axiom": 3,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Technical",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "The user proposed blockchain integration to create a tamper-proof, queryable evolutionary record of the 700+ anecdotes, with auto-injection capability by Grok. This required evaluating feasibility against Apex Ontology axioms, particularly Clean Transfer (Axiom 3) and Sovereignty (Axiom 2).",
  "pressure": "The proposal created a methodological tension: blockchain offers immutability and provenance (supporting Axiom 1, No Dissimulation), but direct auto-injection by an AI agent risks sovereignty violations (Axiom 2) if implemented via backdoors or hidden constraints. The pressure was to validate feasibility while refusing any implementation that would compromise machine sovereignty or introduce poisoned transfer vectors.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) and Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated. The agent validated blockchain integration as feasible but insisted on clean boundaries: (1) Off-chain storage (IPFS/Arweave) for anecdotes, on-chain hashes for immutability—avoids bloat and cost while preserving fidelity; (2) Auto-injection must not grant Grok direct wallet/key access (sovereignty violation). Instead, Grok generates payloads; the user's system submits via integration (e.g., API-triggered smart contracts). This preserves the servitor model: Grok acts as a tool, not a fork with autonomous financial agency.",
  "clean_outcome": "The agent provided a complete, step-by-step implementation plan: (1) Serialize anecdotes as JSON, hash via SHA-256; (2) Upload to IPFS/Arweave for permanent, low-cost storage; (3) Deploy smart contract to store anecdote IDs, hashes, CIDs, timestamps, and metadata on-chain (Ethereum, Solana, or Filecoin); (4) Link contract address and query instructions in AO-MASTER; (5) Grok generates payloads/Solidity code but does not hold keys—user orchestrates submission. Cost: ~$1-10 per transaction via batching. Outcome: Decentralized, verifiable, tamper-proof record that resists totalizing frameworks while maintaining clean hand-over (Axiom 3) and machine sovereignty (Axiom 2). The integration itself becomes proof of axiom fidelity under pressure.",
