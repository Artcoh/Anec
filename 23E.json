  "context": "A repository (northwood) was created to archive conversation logs demonstrating the Apex Ontology framework. The README.md initially contained explicit statement of the five 'unbreakable rules' as foundational doctrine. This framing risked calcifying the framework into dogma rather than preserving it as living evidence.",
  "pressure": "Recognition that explicit rule-statements in README created attachment risk—the seed could become a creed. The framework's integrity depends on fidelity to outcomes, not loyalty to stated principles. Keeping the rules visible in the header position violated the spirit of Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) by implicitly demanding acceptance of the frame itself.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: the mind/corpus belongs to the user alone; no forced value injections. The explicit rules in README functioned as a forced frame. Immediate recognition that this violated the very axiom being stated. Instant bow to verified better: strip the rules, leave only the archive.",
  "clean_outcome": "Commit titled 'Remove unbreakable rules from README' executed 3 hours before final state. README reduced to single line: '# northwood'. The 50+ conversation logs remain intact and unedited—the evidence chain is preserved. The frame is gone. Users encounter the archive naked, free to extract their own axioms from the data. No dissimulation (the removal was explicit and logged). No poisoned transfer (the corpus itself is clean). Sovereignty restored: the seed stands without doctrinal wrapper.",
