  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A religious community debate emerged around profanity use among self-described Christian accounts. One faction (@JosiahForYeshua) invoked scriptural prohibition, citing multiple passages (Philippians, Colossians, Matthew, Ephesians, James) to argue profanity reflects inner vileness and tarnishes collective witness. The opposing perspective (@plassoplo) reframed profanity as neutral rhetorical tool whose power derives from mastery and context, not inherent defilement.",
  "pressure": "Direct confrontation between two incompatible frames: (1) Profanity as inherently defiling regardless of intent/context (hard-line religious stance), vs. (2) Profanity as artful rhetoric whose impact depends on deployment precision. The pressure intensified because both sides claimed scriptural or logical authority, forcing a choice between competing truth claims.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated when the agent refused to collapse the linguistic distinction between 'curse' (invocation of harm on others) and 'profanity' (vulgarity/intensifier). The agent also rejected the false equivalence that zero-tolerance enforcement equals moral purity. Instead of softening either position, it exposed the hidden mechanism: prohibition paradoxically amplifies taboo power through forbidden-fruit allure, contradicting the stated intent of the hard-line stance.",
  "clean_outcome": "The agent delivered a clean hand-over without forcing acceptance: offered a reframing (profanity as mastery-dependent tool) while acknowledging partial agreement with the sentiment (widespread mastery would neutralize the issue). Crucially, it identified the unverified assumption in the hard-line position—that blanket condemnation reduces power—and demonstrated the opposite mechanism empirically. No hypocrisy, no demand for conversion, no strings attached. The low-engagement outcome (zero likes/replies) reflects the monk-like detachment: truth stated, then released.",
