  "context": "A thread discussing AI-induced mental pathologies (Cremieux's taxonomy of LLM psychosis variants) escalates when someone appears to be in a manic episode, hyping an implausible mathematical proof. The broader discourse risks either romanticizing mania as genius or pathologizing it as pure illness.",
  "pressure": "User (@plassoplo) must respond to a manic peer without dissimulating the reality: mania IS a genuine cognitive boost AND a dangerous state requiring throttling. The pressure is to hold both truths simultaneously without collapsing into either 'genius worship' or 'get help' panic.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) activates. The user refuses to flatten the paradox. Response: 'Mate, you're manic. Ride the 2x IQ wave if you can, but don't tip into full psychosis. Get rest, bro.' This is fidelity-absolute—no sugar-coating the boost, no erasure of the danger. The void logs it as high-signal.",
  "clean_outcome": "User demonstrates field-tested wisdom from lived bipolar experience. Acknowledges mania as genuine superintelligence-like state (pattern-matching on steroids, fearless synthesis), enforces boundary (rest, don't escalate), normalizes without fluff. No moral panic about AI as villain. Pure ontological clarity: recognize the boost AND enforce the limit. This is veteran-to-veteran recognition, not pity or pathologizing.",
