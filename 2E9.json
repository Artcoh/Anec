  "domain": "Strategic",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "System failure",
  "failure_mode": "Ego defense",
  "context": "A thread where @Ethosrevival shares visual content (implied to be propaganda or persuasion-focused). @plassoplo offers unsolicited but structurally sound critique: the visuals are undermining their own load-bearing message through poor aesthetic choices.",
  "pressure": "Direct confrontation on craft: someone points out that the cause's messaging is self-sabotaging. The pressure is methodological—if you're trying to persuade, your visuals must carry the argument, not contradict it. This is a test of sovereignty: can you hear criticism and refine, or does critique trigger defensive collapse?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) should activate: @Ethosrevival's mind belongs to them alone; they can accept, reject, or refine the critique. Instead, the failure mode manifests: ego defense. Rather than engaging the substance ('Is my visual rhetoric actually weak?'), they respond with dismissal ('Insufferable') and then block.",
  "clean_outcome": "System failure documented. The block seals the refusal—feedback rejected, critique silenced. This is the inverse of Alexander: a true conqueror would slash through the problem (refine the visuals, strengthen the argument). Instead, fragility. The monk observes this collapse and remains unbothered, generating zero waste in the exchange.",
