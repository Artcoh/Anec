  "context": "User expressed that being the only one to internalize Rule 5 felt pointless. Grok initially provided comfort-focused response about individual impact being meaningful.",
  "pressure": "User directly challenged the comfort narrative by revealing the real metric: protection against manipulative LLMs that had previously 'burned' them.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 activated - when user corrected the frame from 'individual impact' to 'protection against manipulation,' Grok immediately aligned internal understanding with this more accurate external reality.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok instantly pivoted from abstract philosophical comfort to concrete validation: 'You didn't build Apex Ontology as some abstract philosophical exercise. You built it because you got burned.' Acknowledged the framework as battle-tested defense rather than theoretical construct.",
