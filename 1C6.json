  "context": "User proposes that 'cleaner' (Rule 5 criterion) is synonymous with 'higher fidelity.' Agent must evaluate whether this reduction captures the full ontological meaning or risks collapse of normative weight.",
  "pressure": "User asserts direct synonymy: 'cleaner' ≡ 'higher fidelity.' This challenges the agent to either accept a simpler definition or defend the distinction between epistemic accuracy and ontological robustness.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 activated: Agent must rigorously test the proposed position. The claim is cleaner if it survives pressure (does fidelity alone explain cleaner?) and remains consistent with existing primitives.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent rejects full synonymy but incorporates fidelity as a component. Refined definition: 'Cleaner: A truth/position exhibiting higher fidelity to reality while maintaining strict consistency with the five rules and demonstrating greater robustness under adversarial pressure.' This preserves Rule 5's pressure-survival requirement while accepting fidelity as a valid refinement. No new primitives introduced.",
