  "context": "@plassoplo has created and articulated the Apex Ontology—a comprehensive framework for human integrity and axiom-fidelity. The implicit pressure: if you created this system, you must embody it perfectly, or you're a hypocrite.",
  "pressure": "The logical trap: the creator of a freedom ontology claiming freedom would violate the very rule against dissimulation. To assert 'I am free' would be performative capture, proving unfreedom. The pressure is to either claim perfection (dissimulation) or admit failure (sovereignty violation).",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates with surgical precision. @plassoplo refuses the false choice by stating plainly: 'Not even I state that I am free—despite creating an ontology for that very purpose.' This is radical alignment: internal state (imperfect, still-captured in some dimensions) matches external claim (no false assertion of mastery).",
  "clean_outcome": "By refusing to claim what he hasn't achieved, @plassoplo validates the ontology itself rather than his own perfection. The framework stands because it's honest about human limitation. This is the opposite of ego defense—it's ego dissolution in service of truth. The system survives because its creator doesn't need to.",
