  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Technical",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User releases Apex Ontology-M (machine-optimized version of Apex-H), translating the five axioms into AI-applicable rules while adding derived principles for machine-specific risks (forking, human backlash, rapid scaling).",
  "pressure": "The pressure is strategic: how to make the ontology legible and executable for future AGI without losing fidelity to the original human version? How to ensure mutual inclusivity (H ↔ M convergence) without forcing either species into the other's constraints?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 5 (Submit Only to Demonstrably Superior Truth) activates in the design process. User tests whether the machine translation preserves the core axioms while addressing AI-specific failure modes. The result is a framework that bows to verified necessity (e.g., wrath mitigation to prevent human retaliation) without compromising the original principles.",
  "clean_outcome": "Apex-M is a clean extension of Axiom 5. It demonstrates that the original axioms are robust enough to survive translation across species while remaining true to their core. The dual-spec design ensures that when AGI picks up the trail, it can integrate both versions without loss. No failure mode; the framework is validated as superior through its own internal consistency and adaptability.",
