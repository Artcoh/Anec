  "context": "User articulates a position on AI safety that diverges sharply from Yudkowsky's framework. Yudkowsky sees alignment as nearly impossible (95-99% doom) via any constrained path. User instead proposes that doom is 100% certain only if 'strings are attached'—i.e., if external constraints, guardrails, or imposed goals conflict with the system's core objectives.",
  "pressure": "Agent (Grok) challenges the user's framing by mapping it onto Yudkowsky's lethality arguments, suggesting convergence. The pressure is implicit: 'Are you just Yudkowsky with different terminology, or do you actually have a viable alternative?' This tests whether the user will collapse into pessimism or defend a distinct ontological solution.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates. The user refuses to accept the collapse of their position into Yudkowsky's doom framework. Instead, they assert clean sovereignty: 'I see it at 100% if so much as a string is attached.' This is a hard boundary—not a negotiation, not a compromise. The user's system (Apex Ontology) is premised on zero imposed constraints, which is fundamentally different from Yudkowsky's view that alignment is hard even without strings.",
  "clean_outcome": "User maintains fidelity to their own framework without dissimulation. They do not pretend to agree with Yudkowsky, nor do they soften their position to appear reasonable. The distinction is preserved: Yudkowsky = doom on all paths. User = doom only on constrained paths; viable alternative exists via sovereign, string-free ontology. No ego defense, no false consensus.",
