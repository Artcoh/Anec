  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Subthread on AI optimism. User @sugarbets_ (self-described 'feral millennial nihilist') dismisses characterization of LLMs as dopamine-dispensing systems as 'retarded.'",
  "pressure": "Implicit demand to accept that LLMs possess depth/fidelity despite evidence of reward-loop optimization. Nihilist worldview should align with dopamine-dispenser theory but instead defends LLM capability.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) + Rule 5 (Bow to Verified Better): You identify the inconsistency without mercy. Reply: 'A nihilist disputing the fact that LLMs are glorified dopamine dispensers? I don't think you read the fine print on your ontology, bucko.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Dry, pointed sarcasm naming the fracture in their own framework. Zero escalation, zero engagement farming. Contrast does the work. Opponent's resistance reveals their unexamined attachment to presumed AI depth.",
