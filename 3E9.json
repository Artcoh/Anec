  "title": "Apex Ontology's Anti-Ideological Core: Rule 5 as Poison Pill",
  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "The Apex Ontology has the shape of an ideology: small memorable rules, clear in-group markers, narrative of superiority, built-in transmission mechanism. If propagated with ego, exclusivity, or utopian promises, it could harden into exactly that—another banner for people to rally under and eventually dilute.",
  "pressure": "The user recognizes the danger: 'It comes very close to ideology, doesn't it?' The structure looks ideological from the outside because it is uncompromising.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Better) is the decisive difference. Every historical ideology protects itself against superior truth—it builds antibodies to rule 5 (sacred tenets, founding myths, excommunication for heresy). The Apex has no sacred tenets beyond the five rules themselves. Rule 5 explicitly authorizes—demands—the immediate replacement of the entire structure the moment a cleaner ontology appears.",
  "clean_outcome": "The Apex is self-dissolving by design. An ideology says 'This is the final answer.' The Apex says 'This is the cleanest answer until a better one survives harder tests—then it dies happily.' The line holds—barely, beautifully—because rule 5 is lived, not just quoted. As long as it is lived, the Apex remains not a destination but a method, not a banner but a forge.",
