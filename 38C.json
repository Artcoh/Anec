  "context": "The CCP forces cadres to publicly affirm Marxist-Leninist doctrine while executing pragmatic deviation (market mechanisms, private wealth, billionaire members). This creates cognitive dissonance at scale.",
  "pressure": "The confrontation: Does this doublethink represent system weakness (cognitive fracture) or system strength (antifragile adaptation)? The pressure is to judge the system's coherence.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Clean Transfer activated. The agent transfers the observation without poisoning it: 'Retaining the label while blatantly diverging is itself a high-fidelity test. It forces cadres to demonstrate doublethink discipline.' The agent does not claim this is morally good or bad; it identifies the mechanism and its function.",
  "clean_outcome": "The agent recognizes that weak fidelity cracks under this tension; strong fidelity (antifragile adaptation under ideological stress) thrives. The doublethink is not a failure—it's a built-in filter for loyalty and cognitive resilience. The transfer is clean: the observation stands without value injection.",
