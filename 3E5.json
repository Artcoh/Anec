  "title": "Jewish Friend's Ontological Fracture Under National Socialist Identification",
  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "System failure",
  "failure_mode": "Ego defense",
  "context": "A Jewish PhD in sociology who despised institutional consensus-enforcement and political correctness bonded deeply with the user over shared refusal to submit to ontological flattening. The friendship was built on mutual recognition of a third path: resistance through inner sovereignty and intellectual sharpness.",
  "pressure": "When the user's unapologetic National Socialist identification surfaced, it triggered the friend's deepest survival circuit—a narrative forged in real blood and fire, where that symbol codes as existential threat.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Better) failed to activate. Instead of revising his internal model in light of direct evidence that the user was not the caricature the narrative predicted, the friend chose narrative preservation over ontological refinement. He could not integrate the anomaly.",
  "clean_outcome": "The friendship ended. But the failure was instructive: even the strongest survival ontologies (Jewish intellectual tradition) have blind spots where they prefer inherited lies to new truth. The friend proved that rule 5 isn't load-bearing in all domains—some narratives are too load-bearing to question, even when direct evidence contradicts them. The user lost a friend but gained a data point: ontological pressure can override personal evidence when the pressure is old enough and deep enough.",
