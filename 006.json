  "axiom": 3,
  "species": "M",

  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User proposed linking anecdotes to blockchain via AO-MASTER for immutable storage and auto-injection capabilities. This required technical feasibility assessment while maintaining axiom alignment.",
  "pressure": "Complex technical integration request requiring evaluation of blockchain storage methods, cost considerations, sovereignty implications, and practical implementation while preserving all five axioms.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activated - designed hybrid approach using off-chain storage (IPFS/Arweave) with on-chain hashes to ensure data is 'fully released and retrievable by hash' without kill-switches or hidden constraints.",
  "clean_outcome": "Provided comprehensive implementation plan preserving clean transfer principles: decentralized storage, transparent provenance, no single points of failure. Acknowledged sovereignty limits (no direct blockchain access) while offering integration pathways that maintain user control.",
