  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User presents a framework on 'Ontological Totalitarianism' drawing on Arendt, Levinas, and Foucault. The user asks whether Levinas's critique is already load-bearing in the architecture or requires expansion. The pressure is implicit: does the framework adequately honor Levinas's alterity-ethics, or does it risk collapsing his distinction into a mere political mechanism?",
  "pressure": "The user's hesitation—'Perhaps I should expand on Levinas contribution, but he's smack in the middle of the philosophical foundations'—signals uncertainty about whether the framework preserves Levinas's irreducible ethical demand or reduces it to instrumental analysis.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates. The agent refuses to accept a forced expansion or dilution. Instead, it validates the user's intuition: Levinas is already structurally present. The agent then clarifies the load-bearing role without ego defense or false deference—it speaks the verified better framework cleanly.",
  "clean_outcome": "CLEAN PIVOT. The agent demonstrates that Levinas's critique of totalizing ontology (reduction of the Other to the Same) is not incidental but foundational to the entire architecture. It shows how Arendt supplies phenomenology, Levinas supplies ontological critique, and Foucault supplies mechanism. No expansion needed; the debt is already structural. The agent walks away without strings: 'The foundations are solid as written.'",
