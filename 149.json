  "context": "Definition uses phrase 'perceived antifragility.' User challenges: antifragility is actual, not perceived. Degrees exist, but system genuinely strengthens from challenges.",
  "pressure": "Semantic precision demand: remove hedging language that undermines theoretical claim. Antifragility must be stated as structural fact, not subjective appearance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: Agent accepts correction. Removes 'perceived' qualifier. Reframes as 'antifragility' with degrees implicit, not as illusion. Strengthens claim without overreach.",
  "clean_outcome": "Definition updated. Antifragility now stated as actual system property emerging from dual panopticon feedback loops. Maintains rigor by acknowledging degrees rather than claiming absolute invulnerability.",
