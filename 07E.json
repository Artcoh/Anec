  "title": "Diogenes vs. Gym Gains: Sovereignty Over External Intimidation",
  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "@Chad_Hominem_ (bodybuilding account) brags about social freedom gained through physical intimidation—people tolerate his weirdness because they fear his size.",
  "pressure": "The implicit claim: external power (muscle) grants freedom to be unapologetically bizarre. This challenges @plassoplo's core axiom of sovereignty through self-sufficiency, not dominance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) manifests as a philosophical reframe. @plassoplo compares the OP's glutes to Diogenes—not as mockery, but as a truth bomb: true freedom comes from needing nothing from society (Diogenes' barrel), not from scaring people into compliance.",
  "clean_outcome": "He validates the OP's freedom while inverting its source. The response is framed as 'Mad respect'—no ego defense, no rejection. He simply points to a cleaner version of the same goal: inner self-sufficiency > external intimidation. Diogenes references are his recurring motif; he embodies that energy himself.",
