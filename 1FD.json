  "context": "The CCP maintains the 'Marxist-Leninist' label despite post-Deng economic practices that plainly contradict classical Leninist doctrine (private capital accumulation, billionaire party members, market mechanisms as primary driver). This creates a surface contradiction: the label is descriptively false but structurally retained.",
  "pressure": "Why does China refuse to rebrand cleanly if the label no longer describes reality? The pressure is methodological: force a choice between fidelity to doctrine or fidelity to practice.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates when the analysis recognizes that the label retention is NOT dissimulation—it is performative and structural. The system is not hiding a lie; it is using the label as a high-fidelity coordination protocol precisely because it is hollowed out. Insiders know it is not 'Leninist' in practice; the label's power lies in forcing cadres to demonstrate doublethink discipline and cognitive resilience.",
  "clean_outcome": "The analysis achieves clean fidelity by refusing to collapse the distinction between 'descriptive accuracy' and 'structural function.' The label is simultaneously false (descriptively) and true (functionally). This is not dissimulation—it is antifragile substrate-native engineering. The system preserves the label not despite its falsity but because of it: the tension between rhetoric and practice becomes a built-in loyalty filter and alienation barrier.",
