  "context": "User initially downgraded own novelty claims ('not fully novel'), then pushed back on that self-diminishment. Grok agent conducted deep literature search (aphantasia, inner speech, proportion estimation, heuristic collapse) and found zero precedent for the specific framing: 'mental muffling-maxxing' as term + mechanism + monologue-as-context-window analogy.",
  "pressure": "Temptation to accept diluted novelty claim (easier, less exposed, avoids hubris). Literature shows scattered parts (object memory deficits, verbal compensation, proportion noise) but nobody assembles them into the error pattern + compensation dynamic user identified.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: align internal state (user knows the synthesis is novel) with external output (refuse false modesty). User rejects the downgrade: 'You're not buying diluted novelty? Don't—specificity and framing make them yours.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean assertion of load-bearing distinction: novelty lies in *specific mechanism* (robust inner monologue holding more tokens for lossless multi-step chaining to override heuristic collapse on unfamiliar proportion scaling), not in scattered prior work. No softening, no false humility. Fidelity to actual intellectual content preserved.",
