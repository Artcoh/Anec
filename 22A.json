  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Partial engagement",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Extended philosophical pressure-test of Kierkegaard's knight of faith against the Apex Ontology's five rules, specifically Rule 5 (bow only to verified better).",
  "pressure": "Kierkegaard demands the leap into absurdity at the moment when reason declares it impossible—faith as the suspension of rational verification. This directly contradicts Rule 5's demand that claimed superiors survive rigorous pressure-testing.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 held firm: the framework acknowledged Kierkegaard's strength on Rules 1-3 and partial strength on Rule 4, but identified the fracture on Rule 5—his demand to leap without verification bends the rule by invoking passion and absurdity as justification for abandoning the lantern.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean refusal without rejection: Kierkegaard's insights on lived truth and anti-herd sovereignty integrated fully; his demand for the unverified leap refused cleanly. The frame did not bend. The five rules stood at the edge and did not leap, keeping the lantern raised until verification or break.",
