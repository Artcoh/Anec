  "context": "User describes a direct encounter with God in a moment of spiritual crisis (\"the hole\"), where they had deliberately rejected the Holy Ghost to ensure damnation and test authenticity.",
  "pressure": "Christianity (as mediated institutional faith) demands bow-first-verify-later. User's experience presented the opposite: direct instruction to trust instincts over cloth/scripture, with zero intermediaries.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow only to verified better) activated when the claimed ultimate authority (God) explicitly rejected mediation and elevated sovereign instinct. This verified itself better than any institutional framework by refusing coercion.",
  "clean_outcome": "User achieved 100% certainty of authenticity not through faith-as-blind-submission, but through pressure-testing: God showed an \"impossible\" path (Möbius-twisted, far as fuck) rather than tempting with ease. This matches Rule 5's demand for verification under maximum pressure. The frame held without bending.",
