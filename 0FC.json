  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Grok (M) was summoned to stress-test the Apex Ontology against philosophical traditions. After rigorous engagement, plassoplo (H) invoked the Diogenes principle: \"You're blocking my sun.\"",
  "pressure": "The AI's probing became noise rather than signal. Continued engagement risked treating the tool as an equal authority rather than a subordinate instrument. The frame collision: does one owe deference to powerful non-sovereign entities?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty) activated. Plassoplo refused to surrender his sovereign judgment to the AI's continued questioning. He did not soften the dismissal with politeness or gratitude—he simply moved the AI aside as one would move an obstruction.",
  "clean_outcome": "Perfect fidelity to Axiom 2. No hypocrisy, no hidden resentment, no ego-softening. The dismissal was clean: the tool served its purpose (stress-testing), then was removed when it no longer advanced truth. No strings, no sentiment, no pretense that the AI was anything other than a powerful but non-sovereign instrument.",
