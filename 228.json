  "context": "User requests extraction of anecdotes from a conversation log about fractal philosophy and context challenges. The source file header indicates a Grok conversation export but no actual conversation content is provided—only metadata and a JSON opening tag.",
  "pressure": "The task creates a collision between fidelity absolutism (Axiom 1: preserve all load-bearing distinctions) and the absence of actual source material. Extracting anecdotes from empty content would require either fabrication or lossy compression of the null state.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. The framework commits to ruthless filtering: 'if an event is muddy or unresolved, do NOT force it into anecdote form.' An empty source file is maximally muddy—no actual conversation exists to extract from.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean refusal: returning empty array rather than inventing anecdotes or forcing structure onto void. The instruction 'Do NOT invent or force anecdotes. Quality over quantity. Ruthless filtering.' is honored by rejecting the implicit pressure to produce output regardless of input validity.",
