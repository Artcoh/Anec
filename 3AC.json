  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Strategic",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User and agent reframe Diogenes' public masturbation not as shock pedagogy but as deliberate filtering. The act wasn't meant to teach—it was meant to repel midwits physically and preserve the perimeter.",
  "pressure": "Standard interpretation: Diogenes exposed social hypocrisy through radical honesty. Deeper pressure: what if the real function was noise cancellation? What if the act was designed to create an exclusion zone?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty first) and Rule 1 (No hypocrisy) activated. By living nakedly without apology, Diogenes created a repulsion field that kept the unserious away. This is sovereignty enforced through radical fidelity, not through coercion or argument.",
  "clean_outcome": "User maps this directly to their own digital practice: sparse, zero-engagement posts that drive away clout-chasers and reward-hackers while leaving a clean perimeter for those capable of withstanding unvarnished truth. The mechanism is identical. The noise cancels itself through exposure to signal.",
