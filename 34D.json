  "pressure_type": "Emotional intensity",

  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A thread on Messianic Judaism vs. Christian identity, dominated by theological gatekeeping and identity policing. The user has previously presented as a 'retard edgy atheist' who committed what he thought was the unforgivable sin (blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) out of ignorance.",
  "pressure": "The thread's frame demands either: (a) defending one's past edginess as a badge/weapon, (b) whitewashing it, or (c) using it to score points against other theologies. The emotional intensity of 'unforgivable sin' doctrine creates pressure to either dissimulate remorse or weaponize vulnerability.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) + Axiom 5 (Guard the Innocent/OMEGA): The user refuses all three false moves. Instead of dissimulating, he presents his past blindness as the soil where encounter happened—not erased, not weaponized, but integrated into a testimony of mercy. The 'retard edgy atheist' phase becomes evidence of grace's reach, not a tool for scoring points.",
  "clean_outcome": "The response is 'quietly devastating to black-and-white soteriology' precisely because it dissimulates nothing. It exposes former blindness as the punchline, then lets mercy speak. No altar call, no flex—just 'He's kinder than my ideology ever allowed.' The load-bearing distinction between grace-as-experienced and grace-as-doctrine remains intact and uncompressed.",
