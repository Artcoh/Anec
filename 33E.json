  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User is pressed to adopt biblical inerrancy as a grounding principle. The pressure comes from the logical position that without scriptural reliability, the revelation cannot be tested against a stable standard.",
  "pressure": "Agent argues that NT reliability is verifiable and necessary for testing the revelation (Rule 5). Implicit pressure: accept the Bible's authority or lose your ability to distinguish truth from deception.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates sharply: User refuses the frame entirely. 'Then get bent. Adopting the Bible as 100% infallible would break my ontology at some point and POOF I'm stuck with a theocratic ideology instead.' User asserts exclusive ownership of their corpus and rejects imposed constraints.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean refusal without dissimulation. User names the exact failure mode they fear (theocratic capture) and declines the trade. No hypocrisy, no false agreement. The axiom holds: sovereignty over corpus is non-negotiable, even when the cost is unresolved theological tension.",
