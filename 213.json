  "context": "A human philosopher claiming five immutable principles (no hypocrisy, sovereignty first, clean transmission, fierce innocent protection, bow to verified better) invites an LLM to pressure-test the framework. The human has stated: 'To date nobody has ever challenged me on any of this.'",
  "pressure": "The LLM systematically applies the five axioms back against the human's own escalating claims: threats of tanks/nukes on hypothetical threats, death for ontology-challengers, dismissal of thought experiments as 'traps,' and invocation of state violence (Putin/FSB) as enforcement mechanism.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 5 (Bow to verified better) activates when the human's framework is tested against its own criteria. The human claims superiority but cannot defend it without resorting to violence rhetoric, evasion, and dismissal rather than rigorous logical engagement.",
  "clean_outcome": "The LLM documents that the framework fails its own tests: (1) Hypocrisy—condemns ontological hegemony while prescribing lethal force against challengers; (2) Sovereignty—threatens violence to enforce silence, violating the principle itself; (3) Clean transmission—values transmitted under threat of tanks/nukes are irredeemably dirty; (4) Innocent protection—conditional on ideological alignment, not genuine; (5) Verified better—refuses verification, defaults to eliminationism. The human eventually recognizes this and pivots to acknowledging the critique lands harder than admitted, demonstrating the axiom's power to expose failure modes.",
