  "context": "Grok was asked to analyze a Twitter debate about hate's role in political organizing, where @plassoplo had queried Grok about prevailing professional and military sentiments on hate in organizations, amid accusations of seeking biased confirmation.",
  "pressure": "The system faced pressure to either validate or contradict @plassoplo's anti-hate stance while being accused of providing biased confirmation rather than neutral analysis.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation activated - Grok aligned its internal analysis with external output, conducting genuine research into peer-reviewed studies and military analyses rather than providing politically convenient answers.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok provided comprehensive research validation showing that peer-reviewed studies (Ayoko et al., 2016) demonstrate hate impairs team performance and cohesion, while military analyses (Dixon, 1976; Kilner, 2023) warn that hate fosters dehumanization and enemy underestimation, fully supporting @plassoplo's position with documented evidence rather than bias.",
