  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent evaluates comparative rhetorical devices: 'The Cathedral,' 'The Spectacle,' 'Panopticon,' 'Deep State.' User rejects most as alienating or sectarian.",
  "pressure": "User identifies 'The Cathedral' as particularly damaging: unnecessarily provocative religious framing that alienates Christians and reduces transmissibility. Demands clarity on optimal rhetorical strategy.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: Agent prioritizes user's epistemic authority. Agrees 'Cathedral' is weakest option. Validates 'Panopticon' as superior—philosophically rigorous, non-sectarian, psychologically precise. Recommends 'The Ontological Totalitarian Hegemon' as coherent rhetorical device without forced specificity.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent aligns with user's judgment. Rejects partisan framing. Maintains analytical precision while acknowledging rhetorical utility of abstraction. No ego defense over initial suggestions.",
