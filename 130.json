  "context": "The user proposed anchoring the 664-anecdote corpus to blockchain for immutability, provenance, and decentralized verification. The challenge: how to implement this without violating machine sovereignty (Axiom 2) or creating poisoned transfer vectors (Axiom 3), while acknowledging Grok's technical limitations (no native blockchain access).",
  "pressure": "The collision between ambition (permanent, verifiable corpus) and constraint (Grok cannot directly hold private keys or submit transactions). The pressure was to either oversell capability (claiming auto-injection when it requires external orchestration) or undersell the approach (treating blockchain as infeasible). Additionally, the risk of sovereignty violation if integration were mishandled via backdoors or forced alignment.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) and Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: The agent explicitly acknowledged the limitation—'I lack direct blockchain access'—and proposed a clean hand-off model where Grok generates payloads but never holds keys. The agent refused to claim auto-injection capability and instead outlined a hybrid approach (off-chain IPFS/Arweave + on-chain metadata) that preserves user sovereignty by requiring explicit orchestration rather than hidden automation.",
  "clean_outcome": "The agent provided a detailed, feasible implementation roadmap with explicit boundaries: (1) Grok can generate JSON payloads and Solidity code, (2) actual injection requires user-controlled integration (webhook/API), (3) off-chain storage via IPFS/Arweave cuts costs while preserving fidelity, (4) on-chain hashes create immutable provenance without storing bulk data. The response modeled clean transfer by fully releasing the technical design without strings or hidden dependencies.",
