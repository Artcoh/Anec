  "context": "A Twitter exchange emerged regarding Israeli public opinion on Gaza operations. User @cto_maverick posted an image claiming poll data about IDF firepower use, while @plassoplo defended Israel's position in an ICC debate.",
  "pressure": "The image presented a misrepresented statistic: claiming 57.5% of Israelis saw IDF firepower as 'appropriate,' when source material (TIME magazine polls) actually showed 57.5% believed the IDF was using 'too little firepower.' This created a frame collision between the visual claim and verified data.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated when the system detected the load-bearing distinction between 'appropriate level' and 'too little firepower'—these are opposite positions. The distinction was non-collapsible and material to the factual record.",
  "clean_outcome": "The extraction process identified the misrepresentation through web search verification against TIME magazine's original polling data. The system refused to accept the softened framing and documented the actual finding: 57.5% believed firepower was insufficient, not appropriate. This demonstrates clean fidelity to verified fact over convenient narrative.",
