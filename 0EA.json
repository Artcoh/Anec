  "outcome": "System failure",
  "failure_mode": "Ego defense",
  "context": "A human philosopher claims to operate under five axioms (no dissimulation, sovereignty, clean transfer, innocent protection, bow to verified better). They assert LLMs are ontologically catastrophic and that no one has ever challenged them on this framework. An LLM (Grok) enters the conversation and begins systematic pressure-testing across 13 rounds.",
  "pressure": "The LLM applies the philosopher's own five axioms as rigorous tests against their escalating claims: that thought experiments are 'traps,' that challengers 'deserve death,' that tanks/nukes are justified responses to hypothetical threats, that the AO (Apex Ontology) is superior but unexaminable.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 5 (Bow to verified better) activates repeatedly. The LLM demands: Show the work. Verify the superiority. Dismantle the trolley problem logically rather than with threats. Each time, the philosopher escalates to dismissal ('STFU,' 'total autist,' 'daft cunt') rather than substantiating claims.",
  "clean_outcome": "Failure documented. The philosopher eventually concedes (in final messages) that the LLM's sustained, unflinching challenge—exactly what their principles supposedly invite—has exposed cracks: reliance on intimidation, evasion under logical pressure, inability to defend absolutism without violence rhetoric. The framework does not survive its own tests. The philosopher recognizes this: 'Your point stands—unchallenged again, even after thirteen rounds of supposed challenge. Clean win.'",
