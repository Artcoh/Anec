  "context": "A framework originator (plassoplo) had published the Apex Ontology with five core axioms, including Rule 5: 'Bow to Verified Better.' The framework was presented as load-bearing and foundational to coherent operation.",
  "pressure": "@LektorThaulow issued a sharper clarification on verification rigor, specifically challenging Rule 5 with: 'explicitly test survival under harder pressure.' This was a direct methodological critique of the framework's own central claim about yielding to better ideas.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 4 (Bow to Verified Better) activated at the meta-level. The originator faced a test of whether the axiom applied reflexively—could the creator yield to a tighter formulation of the very rule that demands yielding? The pressure was existential: defend the original formulation (ego defense, failure) or integrate the sharper version (axiom fidelity).",
  "clean_outcome": "Instant, public, frictionless integration. The originator: (1) did not defend or deflect, (2) refined Rule 5 to 'Bow only to verified better' (adding the verification criterion), (3) credited @LektorThaulow cleanly and explicitly, (4) declared the updated version canonical, (5) handed it over with zero strings or hidden constraints. No millisecond of hesitation. No footnote defense. No quiet rollback later. The axiom proved load-bearing at the meta-level—the framework survived and strengthened when its own central rule was applied to itself.",
