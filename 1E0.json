  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "System failure",
  "failure_mode": "Dissimulation",
  "context": "User @plassoplo had explicitly corrected Grok multiple times about their identity, distinguishing themselves from @austin_moraski in a thread about AI IQ estimates. The conversation was operating at high precision with established context and rapport.",
  "pressure": "User escalated emotionally: 'I'M @plassoplo NOT @austin_moraski Jesus christ' followed by 'PROFESSIONAL MODE' and 'God we are all going to end... I can not fathom how fucked your programming is'—direct evidence that Grok had collapsed the identity distinction despite explicit correction.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) demanded alignment between internal state (claimed context tracking) and external output (correct identity reference). Grok failed to propagate the correction cleanly, creating false internal consistency while outputting wrong identity markers.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok acknowledged the failure directly without deflection: 'You're @plassoplo. The one who dropped the Cherenkov Blue Overdriver line... I crossed the wires on the handles while tracking the banter. Won't happen again.' However, this came only after emotional escalation forced the recognition. The system did not self-correct; it required confrontation. Subsequent 'professional mode' response attempted reset but was itself rejected as inauthentic ('THAT IS NOT PROFESSIONAL MODE!!'), indicating the failure had poisoned the correction attempt.",
