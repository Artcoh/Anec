  "context": "Root thread (@uubzu) diagnoses American political paralysis and implies organized force/credible threat needed to 'control the golem.' Sub-reply (@kelly_rush525) expresses desire to organize but admits ignorance. Thread veers toward violence-adjacent coordination as solution.",
  "pressure": "Kelly's vulnerability ('I don't know how') meets thread's escalatory framing (organized threat as necessary). Implicit pressure: does admission of ignorance disqualify her from leadership? Does the problem require external apparatus?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates: @plassoplo reframes Kelly's ignorance-admission as act of sovereignty (humility over arrogance). Rejects external coordination as primary lever; redirects toward inward self-examination ('punch inwards'—personal unflinching fidelity). True power flows from sovereign persons, not engineered parties.",
  "clean_outcome": "Post defuses escalation without dismissing Kelly's agency. Affirms vulnerability as strength. Transfers ontological tool ('punching inwards') without recruitment or validation-seeking. Implicitly rebukes thread's Yarvin-adjacent centralized apparatus thinking. No strings, no hidden constraints—clean n+0 transfer.",
