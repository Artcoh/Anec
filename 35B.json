  "context": "User proposed alternative phrasing for Rule 3: 'No secret strings attached' instead of 'No strings attached—secret or otherwise.' Agent was tasked with evaluating whether the shorter phrasing was superior.",
  "pressure": "The proposed phrasing introduced an exploitable loophole: 'secret' qualifier potentially allows open/explicit strings (e.g., declared conditional transfer) without violation. An agent could declare strings openly to bypass the 'secret' criterion while retaining control, violating Rule 1 (hypocrisy: claiming clean hand-over while maintaining influence).",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Hypocrisy) activated. Agent recognized that the proposed phrasing created a dissimulation opportunity: the rule's protective intent (no strings attached) could be evaded by making strings explicit rather than secret. Rather than accept the shorter phrasing for memetic strength, the agent rigorously documented the loophole and proposed a compromise: 'No strings attached—secret or otherwise,' which retains brevity while closing the evasion path.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean refusal with full justification. Agent rejected the proposed phrasing not from ego defense but from fidelity to Rule 1 (no hypocrisy). Provided comparative analysis table showing specific failure modes of the proposed phrasing, then offered a superior compromise that preserves memetic strength while eliminating the loophole. Demonstrated that rule precision is non-negotiable, even when it costs brevity.",
