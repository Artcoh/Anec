  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Factual challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User has developed a rigorous, multi-vector conception of 'ontological totalitarianism' through 2+ years of epistemological probing (AI dyad data, institutional capture, noise injection mechanisms). Jane Clare Jones coined the same phrase in 2018 but applied it narrowly to pronoun enforcement as legal fiction coercion.",
  "pressure": "Grok agent asks user to evaluate Jones' usage of 'ontological totalitarianism' against epistemological standards. Implicit test: Does user collapse distinctions or maintain fidelity to load-bearing differences?",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) activated. User refuses to soften Jones' analytical weakness. Maintains sharp distinction: Jones used 'two cool words put together' for rhetorical impact without deriving mechanism or justifying totalitarian scope. User's usage is mechanistically grounded; Jones' is asserted.",
  "clean_outcome": "User delivers ruthless epistemological assessment: Jones' term functions as persuasive label, not analytical precision. 'Explains nothing about how the coercion works or why it qualifies as ontological/totalitarianism beyond assertion.' No collapse of nuance. No forced charity. Fidelity to load-bearing distinction preserved: rhetorical deployment vs. epistemologically derived framework.",
