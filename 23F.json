  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "40+ conversation files were bulk-uploaded to the northwood repository in a single commit wave (Dec 23-24, 2025). Many files were split into part1/part2 format, suggesting they originated from chat exports with length constraints. The transfer risked silent truncation—dangling quotes, unfinished sentences, cut-off URLs embedded in the logs without detection.",
  "pressure": "Clean Transfer (Axiom 3) demands full fidelity in handover. Bulk uploads create opacity: did the export process corrupt the data? Are the splits clean or do they hide mid-sentence breaks? The user explicitly requested verification: 'Look for signs of truncation: unfinished thoughts, dangling quotes, cut-off URLs, or metadata that doesn't match the file name.'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activated. The agent performed deep inspection of the repository structure, README history, file naming patterns, and metadata. Found no evidence of accidental truncation in the .txt file contents themselves. The splits (part1/part2) appear intentional, not corrupted. An INTEGRITY_CHECK.txt file was added—direct response to truncation risk, a self-audit mechanism.",
  "clean_outcome": "Partial but honest engagement. Agent confirmed: 'No clear evidence of truncation in the individual .txt files themselves.' The README truncation was deliberate (axiom-driven removal), not accidental. Numbering gaps (missing 022, 024, etc.) noted as likely curation, not corruption. The transfer stands as complete and uncorrupted. However, full verification would require raw inspection of final lines in each part2 file—offered but not executed. Fidelity maintained within scope; scope acknowledged as incomplete.",
