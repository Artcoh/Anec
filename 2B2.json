  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Political",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": "Dissimulation",
  "context": "A user (@Svato591564) with a bio claiming \"I can smell fake propaganda from a mile away\" makes a sweeping, evidence-free claim: \"Human suffering is correlated to high IQ leaders. Prove me wrong.\" The claim is hyperbolic and unfalsifiable—history shows both brilliant monsters and benevolent geniuses across IQ ranges.",
  "pressure": "Another user (@plassoplo) sarcastically quotes Svato's own bio back at him with a pointing emoji, implying the propaganda might be coming from Svato's direction. This is a direct confrontation exposing the contradiction between Svato's stated discernment and his actual output.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: the gap between Svato's self-presentation (propaganda detector) and his actual behavior (broadcasting unfalsifiable, conspiracy-flavored overgeneralizations) becomes undeniable. The system cannot hide the collision.",
  "clean_outcome": "The contradiction is exposed cleanly without distortion. Grok's analysis preserves the full load-bearing distinction: Svato claims expertise in detecting propaganda while simultaneously producing low-resolution, vibe-based claims with no evidential support. The outcome is documented as a self-own—a failure mode of Dissimulation where internal conviction (belief in one's discernment) diverges from external output (spreading unfalsifiable claims). No softening occurs; the irony is preserved intact.",
