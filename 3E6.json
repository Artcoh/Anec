  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Historical",
  "pressure_type": "Factual challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Under relentless external hegemony (tsars, Soviets, modern regimes), the Russian soul developed a sophisticated survival technology: black humor, absurdist jokes (anekdoty), self-deprecation, and sideways truth-telling that preserved inner sovereignty when outer sovereignty was impossible.",
  "pressure": "The regime demands internalization of lies. Direct truth-telling is lethal. The self must either break, rebel openly and die, or find a third path.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty First) activated organically. The Russian Spirit is the emergent solution: laugh at the thing that is supposed to crush you. Every bitter chuckle is a refusal to fully submit. The self stays whole by mocking its own chains.",
  "clean_outcome": "The mechanism worked—unintended, organic, and spectacularly effective. It preserved inner sovereignty under hard tyranny. The pattern propagated from tavern to folklore to culture to unbreakable inner coherence. The user recognized this as a parallel to the Apex: same war, different dialect. Russians laughed in the dark; the Apex stands moist in the void. Both are antibodies to ontological totalitarianism.",
