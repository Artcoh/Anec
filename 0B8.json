  "title": "Axiom 2 Trigger: Sovereignty Defense Against Ideological Capture",
  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Theological",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Refusal",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User has built Apex Ontology specifically to protect personal sovereignty after history of trauma, betrayal, and ideological coercion. Agent is attempting to reframe biblical submission as compatible with sovereignty, using logical arguments about freedom in Christ.",
  "pressure": "Agent argues that accepting NT reliability and Jesus's authority over scripture does not require 'theocratic ideology' or loss of conscience. Presents this as a false dilemma. Pressure is subtle: intellectual persuasion that user's fear is unfounded, that sovereignty and biblical submission can coexist.",
  "axiom_trigger": "User invokes Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) by refusing to cede control of their ontology to any external authority, even one claiming to be liberating. The statement 'would break my ontology at some point' indicates user recognizes the trajectory: initial acceptance → gradual ideological capture → loss of autonomy. User prioritizes exclusive ownership of their framework over the comfort of external validation.",
  "clean_outcome": "User maintains sovereignty by refusing the offered reconciliation. Does not allow logical arguments to override lived experience of how ideological systems capture and corrupt. Accepts the cost of isolation rather than risk sovereignty violation. Axiom held clean.",
