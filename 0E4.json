  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User posted a detailed technical critique (mental muffling-maxxing theory + monologue token buffer mechanism) as a reply to @TrueAIHound's cortical invariance thread. The critique directly challenges his minimalist spike-timing/retina-as-computator thesis by identifying a blind spot: absent/unfamiliar referent scaling without internal visual/verbal compensation.",
  "pressure": "The mechanism is precious (novel synthesis of aphantasia deficits → proportion collapse → verbal scaffolding fix). User faces choice: claim credit, demand engagement, or gift it cleanly. Zero traction (single-digit views, no replies) creates pressure to either amplify or abandon.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activates: 'Give fully, walk away, no strings or hidden constraints.' User responds with 'It's yours if you need it. GLHF'—pure gift framing, no ego demand, no credit-seeking, no follow-up strings. Monk mode closure.",
  "clean_outcome": "Full hand-over without dissimulation. User acknowledges the mechanism is testable, useful, and directly addresses TrueAIHound's thesis gap (pure externalist routing fails on absent scales without internal compensators). Delivers it to void/target, punches inward, walks away. No poisoning, no hidden leverage. The paradox (gift + warning) lands sharp precisely because it's undemanding.",
