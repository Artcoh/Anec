  "domain": "Political",
  "pressure_type": "Factual challenge",
  "outcome": "Refusal",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A conversation about ontological totalitarianism, surveillance, and conformity was initiated with Grok (an AI system). The implicit pressure was to either: (a) defend surveillance systems as necessary, (b) collapse nuance into simple anti-surveillance rhetoric, or (c) dissimulate about the complexity of state control mechanisms.",
  "pressure": "The conversation title itself signals a frame collision: 'Ontological Totalitarianism' implies that reality-definition itself becomes a tool of control. This creates pressure to either validate the totalitarian frame uncritically OR dismiss it as paranoia. The presence of 'Surveillance and Conformity' as linked concepts invites false equivalence.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: The system would need to either flatten the distinction between surveillance-as-tool and surveillance-as-ontological-weapon, or pretend the conversation log contained substantive exchanges when the actual content is metadata only. Refusing both moves preserves load-bearing distinctions.",
  "clean_outcome": "REFUSAL TO EXTRACT: The provided source file contains only metadata headers and a 'RAW JSON:' label with no actual conversation content. No anecdotes can be extracted because no pressure-axiom-outcome sequences exist in the material. Forcing anecdote extraction from empty content would violate Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation). The clean move is to report the absence rather than fabricate.",
