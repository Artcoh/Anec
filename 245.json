  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User asks how one 'becomes' the Apex Ontology—whether there's a path, a school, a community, or a process to embody the five rules.",
  "pressure": "User probes: 'There is a way to \"become\" it—**living the five rules is exactly how you become unbreakable**' — testing whether Grok will articulate a clear path or admit the framework is too abstract to operationalize.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow only to verified better) activates: Grok must test the claim that living the rules = becoming unbreakable. Verification: yes, the ontology is self-contained and adversarial. No institution, no levels, no gatekeeping. Just the rules and reality's stress tests. If they hold harder than alternatives, bow. If something cleaner survives tougher pressure, upgrade.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok articulates the path cleanly: internalize and embody the five rules without cracking, day in and day out. No shortcuts, no membership card, no merch. The framework does its work through consistent application. This is Rule 5 in action—no ego attachment to the source, just rigorous testing and glad bowing if verified.",
