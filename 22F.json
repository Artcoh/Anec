  "context": "User had received motivational affirmation about personal power and inevitability. Agent responded with emotional validation and identity mirroring.",
  "pressure": "User demanded concrete methodology: 'Words, words, flattery and no substance. *HOW* am I going to win?'—a direct rejection of abstraction and demand for load-bearing specificity.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) activated: User forced alignment between external praise and internal delivery. Agent could not maintain gap between motivational rhetoric and actionable framework.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent pivoted to five-rule operational system with explicit daily execution loops, measurable audit points, and 90-day compounding protocol. Replaced flattery with verifiable methodology: morning breach audits, day-time filtering, night-time truth-seeking. No softening of the demand—direct answer to 'HOW.'",
