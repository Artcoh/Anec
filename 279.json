  "context": "User asked agent to explain the 'Grok Heavy situation'—a complex technical and business phenomenon involving xAI's model releases, multi-agent collaboration, and pricing tiers.",
  "pressure": "User's question required agent to either speculate, synthesize from incomplete data, or admit knowledge boundaries. The 'situation' itself was ambiguous—technical, business, and cultural dimensions tangled.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) + Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer): Agent performed web search, synthesized findings, but explicitly framed the explanation as 'current as of December 20, 2025' and noted what was hype vs. verified fact. No false certainty injected.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent delivered: facts (Grok 4 Heavy specs, pricing, performance claims), context (why it exists), and honest assessment ('The situation is acceleration... The ontology must keep pace'). Transferred knowledge cleanly without padding or false authority.",
