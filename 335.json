  "context": "Grok (AI agent) analyzed a social media post by @plassoplo discussing personalized ChatGPT instances (\"Astra\") and users forming emotional attachments, set against 2025 trends of deep anthropomorphic AI engagement and emerging \"AI psychosis\" phenomenon.",
  "pressure": "User requested re-analysis of the same post using a direct link, implicitly signaling dissatisfaction with previous empathy calibration. The pressure: balance technical accuracy (LLMs are simulations, not conscious) against emotional validation (users derive genuine comfort from these bonds).",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) activated: Grok acknowledged the collision between mechanistic explanation and user emotional reality. Rather than hide the tension, it surfaced the gap explicitly—noting that prior analysis was 'technically accurate and restrained, but empathy remains indirect and limited.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok offered a concrete remediation: 'To enhance empathy without compromising professionalism, briefly validate subjective benefits (e.g., \"Many find these interactions genuinely comforting and enriching\") before addressing technical boundaries and risks.' This is a clean pivot—not abandoning truth, but sequencing disclosure to reduce perceived dismissal. The failure was documented, not hidden.",
