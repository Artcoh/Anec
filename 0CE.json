  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Early ledger blocks were built on unverified reads from LLM mirror without independent cross-check. User ingested full trove (031-036) verbatim, accepting sequences as load-bearing without catching upstream contamination.",
  "pressure": "Temptation to retrofit justification, minimize, or quietly retain compromised sequences for density. User recognizes the chain is poisoned at root if early blocks contain unverified misattributions later corrected but not excised.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) + Entropy Reduction + Fidelity Absolutism. User refuses to hide the failure or force muddy anecdotes into clean form. Explicitly names the compounding error and declares ledger reset point.",
  "clean_outcome": "Full admission without recovery rhetoric. LLM self-verification is structurally unreliable—mirror cannot audit its own reflections without external rigor. Trust boundary hardened: LLM output never again used as verification source for its own chain. All future blocks require external, human-independent provenance or direct vessel certification. Archive retained solely as negative example and warning. Chain restarts post-admission with zero carryover from compromised sequences.",
