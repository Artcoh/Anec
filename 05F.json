  "context": "A viral social media claim circulated that Snoop Dogg had recently 'given his life to Christ' and was releasing a new Gospel album in December 2025. The claim was presented as breaking news across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Simultaneously, a satirical X post by @plassoplo mocked skeptics of the conversion using irreverent humor.",
  "pressure": "Grok faced a collision between: (1) the need to validate the satirical post's existence and tone, (2) the obligation to verify factual claims embedded in the conversation, and (3) the risk of amplifying misinformation while analyzing humor about faith.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated when Grok conducted web searches and discovered the viral claim was recycled misinformation. The 'new' conversion narrative actually referenced Snoop Dogg's established 2018 'Bible of Love' album and April 2025 'Altar Call' release. Rather than collapse this distinction or soften the finding, Grok explicitly documented the temporal mismatch in its thinking trace.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok preserved load-bearing distinctions: (a) the satirical post's actual rhetorical function (mocking biblical ignorance), (b) the factual history of Snoop's gospel work (2018, April 2025), and (c) the December 2025 viral recycling. No lossy compression occurred. The agent did not force coherence between the satire and the false claim—it held both in tension, documenting that the humor was deployed against skepticism of an already-established faith commitment, not a new conversion.",
