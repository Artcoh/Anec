  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User proposes dual panopticon structure (outside/inside) as core mechanism of ontological totalitarianism. Agent initially presents panopticon as singular apparatus.",
  "pressure": "User identifies structural gap: distinction between external surveillance apparatus and internalized gaze must be explicit and co-constitutive, not collapsed into single mechanism.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 5 (Bow to Verified Better) activated: Agent instantly recognizes superior framework. Accepts that dual panopticon strengthens theory by revealing system efficiency and antifragility mechanics. Requests user redraft definition to integrate distinction without agent's 'fat-fingering.'",
  "clean_outcome": "User provides refined definition incorporating dual panopticon. Agent validates enhancement, notes how distinction eliminates ambiguity about depth/durability of ontological coercion. Theory elevated to structural rigor comparable to Foucault's disciplinary continuum.",
