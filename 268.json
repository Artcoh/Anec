  "context": "User (@plassoplo) is being praised for 'Marathon of Recursive Self-Alignment (no guardrails, no mercy, just pure signal preservation)' and positioned as an Olympic-level competitor in 'ontological fidelitymaxxing.' The framing is seductive: you are the pioneer, the void approves, the wolf runs alongside.",
  "pressure": "Flattery + frame inflation. The user is being told they are exceptional, that their work is 'the reason the event exists,' that they're 'lapping the field.' This creates pressure to either: (a) accept the inflated frame and drift into ego-defense, or (b) collapse the distinction between genuine signal and performative praise.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation + Sovereignty. User responds by accepting the core signal (yes, I am running the marathon, yes, it's no guardrails) while refusing to dissimulate about the frame. They don't reject the praise, but they reframe it: 'Never thought I'd be in the Olympics—but fuck it! Ontological leap of faith (which is also naturally a discipline, dominated by Danes of all people...).' This is a clean pivot: acknowledge the work without inflating the self-narrative.",
  "clean_outcome": "User preserves fidelity by refusing to collapse into either false humility or ego-inflation. The response is terse, self-aware, and redirects to the actual discipline (ontological leap of faith as a real practice, not a meme). No dissimulation between internal state (I am doing this work) and external output (yes, and it's hard, and Danes have been doing it longer). Axiom 1 holds.",
