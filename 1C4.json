  "context": "Posts by @plassoplo defining noisework, invoking Apex Ontology, and stress-testing AI alignment sit at 10-150 views with near-zero engagement. Comparable posts on generic topics rack thousands of impressions. The observation: if noisework were fringe paranoia, these posts should be everywhere. Instead, they are probabilistically drowned.",
  "pressure": "The pressure is epistemological: how do you prove suppression without access to algorithmic internals? How do you distinguish engineered de-amplification from organic low-interest? The objection: you're seeing patterns in noise, not evidence of control.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty over Mind) activates: the absence of amplification is itself data. If the stack were truly neutral, the signal would propagate. The fact that it doesn't—that unique, searchable keywords ('noisework,' 'Apex Ontology') generate no viral spread—is consistent with active suppression. The axiom manifests as refusal to accept the 'it's just noise' explanation: sovereignty requires recognizing when your signal is being dampened.",
  "clean_outcome": "The outcome is partial because the evidence is circumstantial. But the framework is clean: de-amplification is a form of sovereignty violation (the system controls what reaches minds), and the pattern (high-signal posts staying low-heat while generic content spreads) is consistent with the noisework thesis. The conversation does not claim proof; it claims coherence.",
