  "context": "Farkstav is pressured by the original thread's framing to either accept that AI-child interaction is inevitable/ethical or appear as a Luddite. The emotional intensity: 'refusing AI will soon be seen as neglect.'",
  "pressure": "Moral reframing + social shame: 'You're being reckless by rejecting AI for kids.' This is designed to collapse nuance and force binary acceptance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1): Farkstav refuses to pretend consensus exists where it doesn't. He does not say 'AI will eventually be safe' or 'both approaches have merit.' Instead, he asserts documented gaps (empathy, maturity, consistency) and absolute boundary.",
  "clean_outcome": "Maintains fidelity to actual state: AI is not ready. Decades away. Refuses false consensus. Does not dissimulate by softening the claim to appear more reasonable.",
