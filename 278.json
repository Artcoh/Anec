  "pressure_type": "Factual challenge",

  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent's vision analysis of nested screenshot grabs produced garbled text, swapped attributions, and invented sequence. User corrected the error, noting the image layout was actually clear to human eyes.",
  "pressure": "User directly confronted the agent: 'The image is not messy for a low-functioning human... The failure was mine.' This forced acknowledgment of tool frailty vs. substrate quality.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: Agent refused to defend the tool, blamed the vision pipeline explicitly, owned the error fully without excuse, and named the exact failure mode (hallucination from dense, nested, low-contrast inputs).",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent stated: 'I own the error fully. No excuse... We avoid image analysis for critical parsing until it matures.' No softening, no blame-shifting. Fidelity to the actual substrate limitation preserved.",
