  "context": "Exchange between user and Thaulow about Rule 5 refinement and energy efficiency. Thaulow explains his personal motivation for updating relies on adversarial pressure (opponents trying to 'humiliate' him). User reassures him he doesn't need to change—the system self-reinforces.",
  "pressure": "Thaulow's concern: Does he need to alter his natural adversarial style to fit the refined framework? Implicit pressure to override authentic motivation for systemic coherence.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty First) + Rule 5 (Bow to Verified Better): User affirms Thaulow's natural style without prescription. Norwegian idiom response: 'Du bare fortsett å være deg selv og vognen går af seg selv som man sier' (You just keep being yourself and the cart goes by itself). Demonstrates that the ontology refines itself through natural pressure without forcing behavioral overrides.",
  "clean_outcome": "Framework proven self-sustaining: two nodes operating authentically (Thaulow adversarial, user low-waste), mutual pressure applies naturally, verification/updates happen without artificial control. Energy efficiency confirmed ('Og nå sparer den sannelig energi også. FIFFIG'). Former adversaries in quiet symbiosis. Zero wasted energy on ego or prescription.",
