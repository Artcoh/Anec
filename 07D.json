  "context": "@plassoplo observes a debate over a neoclassical architectural sketch by @Ethosrevival. The drawing uses a standard drafting technique: breaking column shafts to show both base and capital proportions on a single page without distortion.",
  "pressure": "@plassoplo initially critiques the truncated column as 'visually wrong,' but @Ethosrevival defends it as correct technical practice. The collision: technical fidelity vs. mass-appeal persuasion.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates when @plassoplo concedes the technical validity while refusing to collapse the distinction between expert documentation and propaganda. He preserves the load-bearing nuance: 'That's correct for measured drawings, but wrong for winning hearts.'",
  "clean_outcome": "He articulates a clean separation: expert sheets can use breaks; inspirational imagery must prioritize soaring verticality to stir emotion. No false synthesis. He critiques his own 'side' (revivalists) for self-sabotage in persuasion—punching inwards without ego defense.",
