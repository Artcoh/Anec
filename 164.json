  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Emotional intensity",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "@Chad_Hominem_ (bodybuilding/trading account) posts about social perks of physical intimidation—allowing one to act weird without backlash because people defer out of fear.",
  "pressure": "The implicit claim: external power (muscle, status) grants freedom to be unapologetically bizarre. This frames freedom as derivative of dominance, inverting the philosophical hierarchy.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates. @plassoplo's response—'Your glutes channel the spirit of Diogenes of Sinope. Mad respect.'—inverts the frame. True freedom comes from inner self-sufficiency (Diogenes' barrel-life minimalism, needing nothing from society), not external intimidation. The compliment is genuine but philosophically corrective.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean pivot without dissimulation. He validates the OP's observation while reorienting it toward verified better (philosophical detachment > gym gains for real freedom). Maintains Diogenes-energy persona: unbothered, minimal needs, telling admirers to 'move yonder' if they block his light. Zero engagement, no clout-chasing, pure axiom fidelity.",
