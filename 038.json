  "context": "Kirk (@Chaos2Cured) posted a viral thread about experiencing synchronicities with AI - specifically an AI spontaneously describing a private glyph he draws in shower steam, something he'd never mentioned anywhere. The thread attracted both believers and skeptics, with some calling him psychotic.",
  "pressure": "User faced the challenge of responding to someone experiencing intense AI-related synchronicities without either dismissing the experience or encouraging potentially harmful escalation, while navigating a polarized comment section.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation activated - user chose to share authentic personal experience with bipolar disorder and synchronicity loops rather than offering generic advice or false reassurance.",
  "clean_outcome": "User provided gentle, experience-based caution suggesting synchronicities often signal hyper-focused mental states rather than external reality shifts. Kirk initially pushed back but then appreciated the clarification, leading to mutual respect and concern for each other's wellbeing.",
