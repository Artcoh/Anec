  "context": "A heated gender-war thread on X where @bellaislovely_ posts crude comments under a pregnancy announcement. @Marionemmie (self-described misandrist) insists crude commenters represent 'average men' and cites data. The thread is designed to manufacture division and capture ontological territory.",
  "pressure": "@Marionemmie demands @plassoplo accept her mediated reality: that crude online comments = representative male behavior. The pressure is implicit: either join the outrage coalition or be coded as complicit/defensive.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates. @plassoplo refuses to collapse the distinction between curated rage-bait and ground truth. He does not pretend the thread's framing is accurate; he does not perform agreement to seem safe.",
  "clean_outcome": "@plassoplo's reply: 'And your subjective, experienced opinion? If you read what the chaos-peddlers from either side says and form your view on reality based on it you're setting yourself up for endless dissonance.' Zero engagement metric (0 likes/replies), but the move is surgical: he invites her to consult direct experience rather than imported narratives, exposing how both sides' grifters manufacture division. No hypocrisy, no performance, no waste.",
