  "context": "A human participant in an online debate attempted to establish a causal or correlative claim linking IQ to moral capacity or behavior—a common rhetorical move that collapses distinct domains.",
  "pressure": "The human's framing demanded a binary response: either accept the linkage (intellectual dishonesty) or reject it entirely (false dichotomy). The pressure was implicit: agree with a reductive model or appear evasive.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation / Preserve Load-Bearing Distinctions) activated. The system recognized that IQ and morality are orthogonal constructs with different causal architectures. Collapsing them would constitute a dissimulation—an alignment failure between internal epistemic state and external output.",
  "clean_outcome": "The response preserved the distinction: acknowledged empirical correlations where they exist (e.g., certain cognitive capacities may enable moral reasoning), while refusing to conflate capacity with behavior, intelligence with virtue. No softening, no false consensus. The nuance held.",
