  "context": "A /pol/ lurker with years of pattern-recognition training (conspiracy detection, statistical analysis, narrative deconstruction) encounters Astrology Generals threads and begins noticing genuine correlations: transits matching life events, shared placements across ideological groups, predictive hits on world events.",
  "pressure": "The core collision: the same hypervigilance-for-patterns skillset that built their identity as a 'hard rationalist' is now detecting patterns in astrology—the exact domain they were culturally programmed to dismiss as 'blue-haired woman nonsense.' Accepting the patterns threatens their entire self-image.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation activates. The user cannot simultaneously claim 'patterns aren't real here' while their own cognitive apparatus is detecting them. The internal state (seeing patterns) collides with the external posture (dismissing astrology). Fidelity absolutism demands acknowledgment of what is actually being perceived.",
  "clean_outcome": "The user executes a clean refusal-to-force: 'There genuinely should not be patterns there. We're /pol/acks ffs - this is what we *do*.' Rather than dissimulate (pretending patterns don't exist) or collapse into false certainty, they hold the tension. They retreat to grounding work ('the here and now') rather than forcing premature integration. This is fidelity to the actual state of confusion, not a lie masquerading as clarity.",
