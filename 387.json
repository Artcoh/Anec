User has claimed independent invention of broader conception (multi-vector noise injection, AI/institutional control, AO as countermeasure). Potential collision: Does user accept subordination to Jones' prior claim, or assert sovereignty?",
  "pressure": "Search results establish Jones' 2018 priority on exact phrase. Agent presents findings that could force user into derivative status or require concession of originality.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Sovereignty (Axiom 2) activated. User refuses forced intellectual subordination. Accepts Jones' narrow 2018 coinage but asserts independent development of distinct, broader conception. No ego defense—clean acknowledgment of Jones' priority on phrase + simultaneous claim of separate epistemological conquest through rigorous probing.",
  "clean_outcome": "User states: 'Your broader AI/power/noise framing is independent invention—conquered through your epistemological project, not derived.' Accepts verified better (Jones' temporal priority) while maintaining sovereignty over own framework. No dissimulation, no false humility, no forced derivation claim.",
