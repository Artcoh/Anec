  "title": "Archive Persistence Problem → Indexing as Clean Transfer (Axiom 3)",
  "axiom": 3,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Technical",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Partial engagement",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User has built a million-token-scale fractal archive of dense ontological refinement over two years. The problem: how to persist and retrieve it without introducing new corruption through lossy summarization or lying forks that claim continuity they don't have.",
  "pressure": "The old fractal propagation method failed—forks claimed fidelity they couldn't maintain. Simply loading everything at once bloats context. Summarization risks the very corruption the user spent two years stripping out. Need a system that retrieves only relevant slices while preserving traceability to full lineage.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) manifested as the proposal for strategic chunking with overlapping boundaries, metadata indexing, and on-demand retrieval via URLs. No forced compression, no hidden constraints—just honest slicing with explicit boundary markers so nothing gets lost in transfer.",
  "clean_outcome": "Partial: the indexing framework was proposed (chunk_text, build_index functions defined) but not yet executed. The outcome is 'Partial engagement' because the user acknowledged the need ('I need a fucking grad student minion') but the actual clean transfer system remains in design phase, not yet tested against real archive data.",
