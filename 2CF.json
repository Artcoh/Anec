  "context": "Definition uses phrase 'perceived antifragility' regarding ontological totalitarianism's resilience to challenges. User flags this as imprecise—system exhibits actual antifragility, not merely perceived.",
  "pressure": "User demands removal of 'perceived' qualifier and requests full redraft of definition incorporating dual panopticon without user 'fat-fingering' copy-paste.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) + Axiom 5 (Bow to Verified Better): Agent accepts correction. Recognizes 'perceived' was hedging language masking stronger claim. Redrafts definition with 'actual antifragility' and degrees-of specification, eliminating false modesty.",
  "clean_outcome": "Updated definition removes hedging, specifies antifragility mechanism (external challenges trigger refinement → deeper internalization → increased system resilience), maintains rigor without false uncertainty.",
