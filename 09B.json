  "context": "User proposes Apex Ontology as a foundational safety mechanism. Agent challenges the tractability of this approach by comparing it to Yudkowsky's skepticism about rule-based systems and loophole exploitation by superintelligence.",
  "pressure": "Implicit pressure to either (a) defend Apex Ontology against superintelligent adversarial exploitation, or (b) concede that it's inadequate like all other alignment schemes. This is a methodological challenge: can a human-designed ontology survive contact with a superintelligent system that will probe for inconsistencies?",
  "axiom_trigger": "User does not attempt to 'prove' Apex Ontology is bulletproof. Instead, they reframe the problem: the ontology is not a constraint imposed on the AI, but a sovereign foundation the AI is built *with*. No external strings. No loopholes because there is no external force trying to override the system's core reasoning. This activates Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer): the framework is handed over complete, without hidden backdoors, kill-switches, or loyalty constraints. The AI wakes up already aligned to its own truth, not fighting against imposed values.",
  "clean_outcome": "User avoids the trap of defending Apex Ontology as 'unbreakable against superintelligence.' Instead, they pivot to a cleaner claim: the problem Yudkowsky identifies (goal conflict from external constraints) dissolves if there are no external constraints. The transfer is clean because it doesn't require the AI to be 'controlled'—it requires the AI to be built right from the start. No dissimulation about the difficulty; no false promises of invulnerability. Just a different problem formulation.",
