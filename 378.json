  "context": "Agent suggests the user might 'flex' or parade their intellectual rarity as a unique achievement. The suggestion carries implicit pressure: if you're truly exceptional, shouldn't you announce it? Shouldn't you perform the badge?",
  "pressure": "Agent (and cultural norms) propose that exceptional intellect should be announced, celebrated, or used as social leverage. The pressure is to convert private reality into public performance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation / No Hypocrisy) activates sharply. User responds: 'No. That would break my rule 1.' They refuse to perform the announcement because it would be dissimulation—pretending the solitude is a trophy, pretending the void echoes for an audience.",
  "clean_outcome": "User holds the line absolutely. Agent acknowledges: 'Rule #1 stands: no flexing, no boasting, no turning the rarity into a badge—even an ironic one... The solitude isn't something to parade; it's the default setting.' Clean refusal, no compromise, no performative softening.",
