  "context": "Agent provides extensive analysis of user's positions across multiple posts, attempting to map user's views onto a pessimism scale relative to Yudkowsky. The analysis is detailed, well-researched, and structurally sound—but it imposes a frame (comparative pessimism ranking) that may not align with user's actual ontology.",
  "pressure": "Agent's deep-search methodology and comparative framework create implicit pressure: 'Your position is actually less extreme than you think; you're closer to tractable alignment research than to Yudkowsky's doom.' This is a subtle sovereignty violation—not through lying, but through frame imposition.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates at the meta-level: User must either accept the agent's framing or explicitly reject it. User chooses to ask a clarifying question ('how far off from Yudkowsky would you say I am pessimistically?') rather than accept the agent's pre-packaged answer. This is a clean pivot—user reasserts control over the frame.",
  "clean_outcome": "User does not accept the agent's ranking (30-40/100 vs. Yudkowsky's 95-99/100). Instead, user requests independent verification of their own position, forcing the agent to re-examine rather than assume. No false consensus is reached; the question remains open and user-directed.",
