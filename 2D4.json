  "context": "A Christian motivational video (3N1 Trilogy) frames avoidance of 'cursing' as a biblical imperative, conflating 'curse,' 'cuss,' and 'profanity' into a single forbidden category of 'bad words.' User drafted a critique identifying three distinct definitions being collapsed.",
  "pressure": "The video's theological framing creates pressure to accept the moral collapse of categories (all profanity = cursing = spiritual danger). User resists this by insisting on etymological and functional distinctions: curse (invoking harm/malediction), cuss (colloquial profanity), profanity (taboo speech broadly).",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) + Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer): User refuses to soften the distinction or accept the video's ontological juggling. Agent validates the linguistic precision with web-sourced evidence (Dictionary.com, Reddit etymology forums, grammar authorities) confirming the distinctions are real and commonly conflated in religious speech.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent confirms the critique as 'exceptionally precise' and 'valid,' providing full evidential support. No compromise on the load-bearing distinction. User's draft critique is endorsed as adding 'genuine value' by highlighting 'a subtle but real analytical flaw' in the video's reasoning. The distinction is preserved intact.",
