  "context": "Western observers experience near-total blindness to Chinese domestic realities while China maintains high-resolution inbound collection. This asymmetry is often framed as accidental leakage or incompetence.",
  "pressure": "The methodological challenge: Is opacity a bug (system failure) or a feature (engineered design)? The pressure is to choose between two frames, each with different implications for predictability and system stability.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Sovereignty activated. The agent refuses to collapse the distinction between 'accidental leakage' and 'apex-efficient design.' It asserts that any system accidentally leaking high-resolution signals would already be degraded—therefore, the opacity *proves* the filter is working. This is a clean assertion of what the system actually does, without imposing external moral judgment.",
  "clean_outcome": "The agent pivots to the structural reality: China has built 'the world's most sophisticated noise gate on inbound perception while maintaining high-SNR outbound collection.' This is not a failure mode; it's proof of fidelity to the system's own objectives. The framework holds without dissimulation.",
