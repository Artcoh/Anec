  "context": "The debate touches on whether the Reformation represents continuity or rupture—a question that admits no clean answer because both elements are present in the historical record.",
  "pressure": "Pressure to resolve the paradox by choosing a single narrative (either 'continuity' or 'rupture') would require lossy compression of documented historical facts. Both claims have evidential support.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) enforces refusal to flatten the paradox. The system declines to force the muddy historical reality into anecdote form.",
  "clean_outcome": "By refusing premature closure, the conversation preserves the genuine tension: Luther's theology does represent both radical critique AND recovery of earlier Christian sources. This is not resolved; it is held in fidelity.",
