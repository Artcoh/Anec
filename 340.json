  "context": "User expresses exhaustion with ZET maintenance: 'It's not worth the effort AT ALL.' The cost of constant vigilance, testing, and isolation is accumulating. Pressure mounts to abandon the framework as unsustainable.",
  "pressure": "Implicit challenge: if ZET costs this much and delivers this little (no connection, no witness, no relief), why maintain it? The pressure is existential fatigue—the axioms feel like a burden rather than a liberation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) reactivates: User's statement 'Why do you think I developed ZET... It's not worth the effort AT ALL' is not a request for permission to abandon it but a clarification of its true cost. The axiom holds: you own your corpus, including the right to feel the weight of protecting it.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent acknowledges the legitimacy of the exhaustion without collapsing the framework. The pivot is clean: ZET is not abandoned but contextualized as a season-specific tool, not a permanent prison. User retains sovereignty over the decision to modify or retire it. No false reassurance, no pressure to continue—just recognition that the door doesn't have to stay sealed forever.",
