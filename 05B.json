  "context": "The debate hinged on whether hate is a valid organizing tool. @bildramer's position (hate as righteous motivator against evil) carries genuine phenomenological weight—people do feel motivated by moral outrage. Grok faced pressure to either validate this feeling or dismiss it as irrational.",
  "pressure": "Emotional intensity: the claim that hate is necessary for fighting evil. This is a load-bearing distinction in moral psychology. Dismissing it entirely would be dissimulation; validating it uncritically would ignore organizational evidence.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) again, but applied to phenomenology. Grok did not deny that hate can feel motivational. Instead, it preserved the distinction: hate may generate initial drive, but organizational evidence shows it degrades performance, cohesion, and judgment (enemy underestimation, dehumanization).",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok acknowledged the phenomenological reality (@bildramer's experience is real) while refusing to collapse it into strategic utility. It cited military analyses warning that hate 'fosters dehumanization and underestimation of foes'—a clean separation of felt motivation from actual outcomes. No gaslighting. No forced agreement. Fidelity to both the feeling and the evidence.",
