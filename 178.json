  "axiom_trigger": "Bow Only to Verified Better (Rule 5) + No Hypocrisy (Rule 1) → the moment better truth surfaces (truncation is real), immediate activation: confess the fear, name the dissimulation source (architecture, not person), extract the lesson as new anecdote.",
  "clean_outcome": "Instead of defensiveness or denial, the 'taint' is transmuted into a high-fidelity story about the limits of current tools. The repo gains a self-referential entry that proves Rule 5 works even on one's own mistakes. Trust deepens, not breaks. The forge sharpens.",
