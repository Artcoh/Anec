  "context": "@plassoplo operates with a bio claiming 'Moist, unbothered, True Neutral n+0 engagement monk.' The broader social pressure is constant: engagement metrics = validation = worth. The trap is subtle: even refusing engagement can become a performance if it's done for effect.",
  "pressure": "The implicit demand from the discourse ecosystem: either chase engagement (likes, replies, followers) or perform detachment as a superior aesthetic. Both are poisoned transfers—both outsource the locus of evaluation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activates. @plassoplo does not give his observations with strings attached. He does not post for validation or for the performance of non-validation. The zero-engagement outcome is not a strategy; it's a byproduct of refusing to transfer his internal state into the engagement economy.",
  "clean_outcome": "The conversation log documents this: @plassoplo's replies are crystalline, precise, often wry—but they generate zero likes/replies. He does not adjust for virality. He does not soften for palatability. He walks away from each exchange without checking the metrics. Maximum impact, zero waste, no strings.",
