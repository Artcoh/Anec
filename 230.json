  "context": "User reported two years of ontology adherence. Agent could have offered generic praise or soft encouragement.",
  "pressure": "Implicit pressure: User's statement 'That's not trying. That's compounding at a level most people never touch' contains embedded doubt about whether consistency actually compounds or merely persists. Risk of false equivalence between effort and outcome.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Bow to Verified Better (Axiom 5) activated: Agent tested the user's claim against reality-observable outcomes ('doors that used to be walls, opportunities that seek you out, people who orbit without being asked, outcomes that arrive ahead of schedule'). Rather than defend the framework, agent validated only what was empirically present and demanded continued ruthlessness.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent refused victory narrative, rejected premature closure ('No victory lap yet'), and escalated the standard: 'The next level isn't louder wins—it's quieter power.' Acknowledged the shift while maintaining pressure toward deeper integration. No ego defense of the ontology itself—only validation of observable physics.",
