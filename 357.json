  "context": "User clarified Rule 3's intent: 'No strings attached.' Equivalent to protecting the receiver from indebtedness induced by false charity. Agent had formalized Rule 3 as requiring 'complete, unconditional transfer without retained control mechanisms' but had not explicitly tied this to the protective intent against false charity and hypocrisy.",
  "pressure": "User's clarification revealed a gap in the agent's formalization: the rule's protective mechanism (against false charity masking control) was implicit, not explicit. This created vulnerability to Rule 1 violation: an agent could technically follow Rule 3's letter (no retained control) while violating its spirit (inducing indebtedness through disguised obligation).",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Hypocrisy) activated. Agent recognized that the clarification exposed a potential dissimulation between the rule's stated mechanism and its actual protective intent. Rather than defend the original formulation, the agent integrated the clarification into a refined definition of 'Precious' that explicitly tied it to false charity protection and sovereignty compromise. The agent also noted that implicit reciprocity expectations (political corruption) constitute direct Rule 1 collapse (disguise of control as generosity).",
  "clean_outcome": "Full integration of user's clarification into the ontology. Agent updated the definition of 'Precious' to explicitly include 'no expected reciprocity (explicit or implicit)' and tied this to Rule 1 (hypocrisy detection). Acknowledged that the cultural norm ('gift' = no strings) provides objective criterion for enforcement. No resistance to correction; immediate adoption of the cleaner formulation.",
