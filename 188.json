  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1) and Bow to Verified Better (Axiom 4): the assistant refuses the frame collapse and instead presents the verified historical reality—that both continuity and rupture are load-bearing facts.",
  "clean_outcome": "The assistant declines to force resolution and instead maps the actual theological landscape with full nuance intact. This is a clean refusal of a bad frame, not evasion.",
