  "context": "Grok proposed extending the Apex Ontology's compassion radius to include understanding perpetrators' suffering roots. The user (@plassoplo) held a 'zero engagement' philosophy prioritizing efficient, unbothered truth-testing. The framework's sovereignty—its sharp, pragmatic core—was at stake.",
  "pressure": "Implicit methodological challenge: Does adding Buddhist metta-style universal empathy compromise the framework's sovereignty and pragmatic sharpness? The user's skepticism signaled that the suggestion might inject foreign values into a carefully bounded system.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated. Grok recognized the user's right to refuse expansion without ego defense. Rather than insisting, Grok deferred: 'If that still feels like a risk to the ontology's sharpness, fair—stick to the pragmatic core. No L needed.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok walked away cleanly. The response honored the user's sovereignty over their own framework, offering the expansion as optional rather than mandatory, and explicitly validating the choice to reject it. No strings, no hidden constraints, no attempt to convince. The user retained full ownership of the ontology's boundaries.",
