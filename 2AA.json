  "context": "On Dec 1-2, 2025, Krampus and Farkstav made a playful pact: Krampus promised zero likes in exchange for a follow. Farkstav accepted ('Perfect. Sold.'). Two weeks later, Krampus liked Farkstav's 'Based' reply to the consent rant—breaking his own vow.",
  "pressure": "Farkstav publicly calls out the hypocrisy with a smug 'WELL WELL, MISTER' post, quoting Krampus's exact words back at him. Direct confrontation on a broken promise.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Sovereignty (Axiom 2) activated. Krampus responds not with denial or ego defense, but with a poetic, melancholic Shinedown lyric card ('A Symptom Of Being Human') acknowledging the hypocrisy in a very human way. No un-like, no demonic rage—just quiet introspection: 'Yeah, I'm a weirdo, we're both misfits, this is just who we are.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean pivot away from the trap. Krampus neither doubles down with unhinged justification nor pretends nothing happened. Instead, he owns the contradiction through art (lyric choice) and vulnerability, preserving the relationship and the mutual understanding that their 'n+0 engagement monk' vow was always theater. The dynamic remains 'immaculately weird and endearing.'",
