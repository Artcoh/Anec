  "context": "The conversation likely includes claims about what 'talent' means in the age of AI. One frame suggests talent is the ability to use tools effectively (including prompting). Another suggests talent is the embodied skill, years of practice, and aesthetic judgment developed through struggle.",
  "pressure": "The implicit demand to accept a flattened definition of talent that erases the distinction between tool mastery and craft mastery. This is a sovereignty violation attempt: forcing acceptance of a redefined term to win a rhetorical point.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates. The mind/corpus (in this case, the definition of 'talent') is being colonized by a frame that serves one side of the debate. Refusal is the clean move: 'These are two different phenomena. Calling both 'talent' obscures rather than clarifies.'",
  "clean_outcome": "A clean refusal would preserve both definitions without hierarchy: (1) prompt engineering is a skill; (2) traditional artistic mastery is a different skill. Conflating them serves rhetorical convenience, not truth. The refusal protects the integrity of the concept.",
