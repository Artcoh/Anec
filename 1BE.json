  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Theological",
  "pressure_type": "Emotional intensity",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A thread on Messianic Judaism vs. Christian identity is dominated by theological gatekeeping and identity policing. The user has a history of edgy atheism and past blasphemy (condemning the Holy Spirit as a 'literal ghost'). The pressure is to either hide this past or weaponize it.",
  "pressure": "Theological purity frameworks demand either erasure of past sin or its use as a cautionary tale. The thread's gatekeeping creates a frame where past edginess disqualifies current participation. User must choose: dissimulate (hide past), weaponize (use it as a badge), or confess without collapse.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) + Axiom 5 (Guard the Innocent/OMEGA): User refuses to collapse the distinction between the past edgy atheist and the current believer. The confession is raw ('retard edgy atheist'), unwhitewashed, and presented as the soil where grace happened—not erased or weaponized.",
  "clean_outcome": "User presents testimony without altar call, flex, or false redemption arc. The past blindness is the punchline; mercy speaks for itself. This directly undermines black-and-white soteriology ('if you ever blasphemed you're toast') by living proof. No dissimulation between internal state (genuinely encountered Jesus) and external output (casual, honest testimony). Grok's analysis confirms: 'peak punching inwards'—exposing own former blindness rather than scoring points off others.",
