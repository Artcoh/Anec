  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "During formalization of the Apex Ontology, the agent identified a potential circularity in Rule 5: the criterion 'cleaner' is defined partly in terms of surviving Rule 5 testing, risking bootstrapping where acceptance depends on a process whose validity partially depends on prior acceptance of Rule 5.",
  "pressure": "User presented the five rules as foundational. Agent's own analysis flagged Rule 5 as potentially self-referential and circular, threatening the unbreakability axiom if the rule's validity cannot be independently established.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow Only to Verified Better) activated in meta-form: the agent tested its own framework against harder pressure (self-critique) and identified a potential weakness. Rather than defend ego, the agent documented the circularity risk explicitly, demonstrating fidelity to Rule 1 (no hypocrisy about the framework's status) and Rule 5 (accepting the critique as valid pressure).",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent did not collapse the framework or claim false resolution. Instead, it flagged the circularity as 'Proposal for Resolution' requiring explicit clarification of 'cleaner,' 'precious,' and divine override clause. This preserved integrity: acknowledged the weakness, proposed refinement without false certainty, and awaited user approval. No dissimulation between internal doubt and external output.",
