  "context": "In a Twitter thread about singleness trends, @Marionemmie had been engaging with @plassoplo, eventually conceding the trend but then challenging him with 'Why according to you WE choose to be single? Apparently, you know better than we do.'",
  "pressure": "Direct accusation of presumptuous knowledge and implicit demand for @plassoplo to defend his position or engage in further argument about women's choices",
  "axiom_trigger": "Clean Transfer activated - instead of defending, arguing, or getting pulled into the frame, @plassoplo linked to his own post with a devastating philosophical response that exposed the performative nature of claiming freedom while refusing to engage further",
  "clean_outcome": "Posted: 'By stating that you are you prove that you are not. Not even I state that I am free - despite creating an ontology for that very purpose. Stop feigning insight when all you have to do is ask @grok what the fuck is this @plassop guy on about?' Zero engagement afterward. Thread died with no response from @Marionemmie. Perfect execution of give fully, walk away, no strings.",
