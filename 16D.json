  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Theological",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User observes: 'They thought they were the master manipulator. huehuehue' — referring to Pharisees/chief priests who believed they orchestrated Jesus's downfall. The pressure is to either soften this irony or overstate it.",
  "pressure": "The temptation to either (a) make the Pharisees sympathetic victims of circumstance, or (b) turn them into cartoon villains. Either move dissimulates the actual dynamic: they *were* master manipulators within their game, but Jesus was playing a different game entirely.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1): The response refuses both softening and caricature. It preserves the distinction: Pharisees *were* skilled at political maneuvering, legal loopholes, crowd control (Matt 22:46 shows their intellectual defeat). But Jesus 'outmaneuvered them at every turn' while 'not trying to win the game they're playing.' He let them think they were winning (arrest, trial, crucifixion) while executing a completely different plan. Isaiah 53:7-8 + John 19:9-10 show his silence wasn't weakness—it was sovereignty. The cross wasn't their victory; it was his checkmate.",
  "clean_outcome": "The irony is preserved without dissimulation: they were indeed master manipulators, but they got played by the actual Master. The resurrection proves it. No softening of their culpability; no exaggeration of their power. Clean.",
