  "context": "Discussion of how conformity is enforced and internalized in totalitarian systems, with implicit pressure to treat voluntary compliance and coerced compliance as equivalent categories.",
  "pressure": "The conversational gravity toward collapsing the distinction between external enforcement and internalized self-policing—treating them as functionally identical rather than phenomenologically distinct.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation: refused the lossy compression that would merge these into a single 'conformity' category. Maintained that the mechanism of internalization (where the subject becomes their own enforcer) is categorically different from external coercion, even if outcomes appear similar.",
  "clean_outcome": "Preserved the distinction that totalitarian control achieves its deepest grip precisely when subjects stop experiencing it as external pressure and begin experiencing their own constraint as self-generated preference. Collapsing this distinction would be dissimulation.",
