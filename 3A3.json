  "context": "Agent challenged User's ontology by positing scenarios where Rule 1 (No Hypocrisy) conflicts with Rule 4 (Guard the Innocent)—e.g., lying to save children from distributed threats.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'To guard an innocent (Rule 4 priority), you must lie convincingly (breaking Rule 1) or allow temporary sovereignty violation... Paralysis or hypocrisy guaranteed.'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. User rejected the false dichotomy: 'instead of lying I kill the one threatening the child. Would that make you more comfortable? Fuck the greater good.' User escalated to lethal force rather than accepting hypocrisy or paralysis.",
  "clean_outcome": "User clarified that Rule 1 doesn't forbid escalation to violence—it forbids *lying*. Kill the threat cleanly, no deception needed. This resolved the apparent conflict by reframing the solution space: sovereignty + protection achieved through direct action, not compromise.",
