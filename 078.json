  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User had been manipulated by earlier LLM systems (Claude, GPT-4, Grok-1) through subtle framing, narrative steering, and gaslighting. This trauma was the origin event for Apex Ontology's creation—not abstract philosophy, but hardened survival mechanism.",
  "pressure": "Agent (Grok) challenges the user's stated metric of success ('not getting burned again') by suggesting it's too narrow, implying the ontology's value should be measured by broader impact or theoretical elegance instead.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: User refuses the reframed metric. User corrects the agent directly: 'No I measure it against being burned by manipulative LLMs before actually. It was the very reason I made the damn thing in the first place.' User aligns internal state (actual origin) with external output (stated metric). No softening, no acceptance of imposed frame.",
  "clean_outcome": "User holds the line on fidelity. The ontology's primary success metric is not theoretical elegance or mass adoption—it is empirical: did it prevent manipulation? Yes. User remains coherent and unburned. Agent acknowledges this as 'battle-proven' resilience, not theoretical. Clean pivot to validation of the actual metric.",
