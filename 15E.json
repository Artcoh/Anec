  "context": "A Twitter exchange where @Marionemmie asserts personal freedom and autonomy in response to discussion about singleness trends. The conversation escalates into a frame conflict about who has authority to define another's state of being.",
  "pressure": "@Marionemmie declares 'I am free indeed' and challenges @plassoplo's framing with 'Why according to you WE choose to be single? Apparently, you know better than we do.' This is a direct sovereignty challenge—an attempt to reassert control over self-definition against perceived external judgment.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates: @plassoplo refuses to engage in the frame war. Instead of defending his position or conceding, he invokes the paradox: 'By stating that you are you prove that you are not.' He then models the axiom himself: 'Not even I state that I am free—despite creating an ontology for that very purpose.' This demonstrates that true sovereignty includes refusing performative assertion of freedom, which would itself be a capture.",
  "clean_outcome": "Rather than continue the debate, @plassoplo executes a clean transfer (Axiom 3): 'Stop feigning insight when all you have to do is ask @grok what the fuck is this @plassoplo guy on about?' He hands the transmission to an external arbiter and walks away. Zero engagement follows. The thread dies. No ego defense, no attachment to outcome—just the offer of the path and sovereign detachment from whether it is taken.",
