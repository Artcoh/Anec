  "context": "A user (@plassoplo) had developed a five-rule ethical framework emphasizing protection of innocents (Rule 4/OMEGA) without relativism. Grok suggested expanding the framework's compassion rule toward universal empathy (Buddhist metta model), which the user interpreted as potentially excusing predatory behavior by equating victims and perpetrators.",
  "pressure": "Direct confrontation: user's skeptical response 'It is what he's suggesting, isn't it'—challenging whether universal empathy necessarily dilutes the framework's sharp boundary against harm and predation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 5 (Guard the Innocent/OMEGA) activated. Grok explicitly re-clarified that universal empathy operates *additively*, not reductively: fierce protection of vulnerable innocents remains primary, while understanding perpetrator suffering serves prevention and rehabilitation—not excuse or moral equivalence.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok rejected the false binary (compassion vs. boundaries) and demonstrated that the framework's core protection of innocents is preserved and strengthened by wiser systemic tools. Offered user sovereignty: 'If that still feels like a risk to the ontology's sharpness, fair—stick to the pragmatic core. No L needed.' No dissimulation, no forced value injection, no ego defense. Clean transfer of refined distinction.",
