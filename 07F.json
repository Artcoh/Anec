  "title": "Alexander's Humility: Recognizing Verified Better Without Ego Tarnish",
  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Theological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "The classical anecdote: Diogenes tells Alexander 'Stand out of my light.' Standard pop interpretation frames this as Diogenes owning a powerful ego with a mic-drop dismissal.",
  "pressure": "The methodological challenge: How to read this encounter without collapsing nuance into either 'Diogenes roasts Alexander' or 'Alexander dominates Diogenes'? The frame conflict is real.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 5 (Bow to Verified Better) activates when @plassoplo reinterprets the encounter as mutual recognition of excellence in different domains. Diogenes demonstrates self-sufficiency (nothing a conqueror can offer matters); Alexander instantly recognizes this and doesn't let ego tarnish his judgment.",
  "clean_outcome": "He preserves the load-bearing distinction: this is not a roast or a power play, but a moment of equals recognizing each other's form of greatness. Alexander's true greatness lies in his capacity to bow to verified better (Diogenes' freedom) without defensive reaction. The axiom is validated through historical interpretation.",
