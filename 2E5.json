  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A religious account (@JosiahForYeshua) critiques Bible-believing Christians for using profanity, citing multiple scriptures (Philippians, Colossians, Matthew, Ephesians, James) arguing it tarnishes witness and reflects inner vileness. The thread gains moderate engagement (102 likes, 36 replies).",
  "pressure": "Direct confrontation between two frames: (1) Hard-line purity doctrine treating profanity as inherently defiling regardless of context, vs. (2) Rhetorical mastery treating profanity as a neutral tool whose power derives from controlled deployment and discernment.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Sovereignty First activated. The response (@plassoplo's framing) refuses to accept imposed linguistic control mechanisms. It defends individual discernment over blanket purity mandates, asserting that mastery (not prohibition) neutralizes the weapon. This preserves the speaker's right to choose language based on intent and context, not external rule.",
  "clean_outcome": "The reply reframes the entire debate at meta-level: Zero-tolerance paradoxically amplifies profanity's power through taboo elevation. True mastery (discernment in use) would render it harmless. No personal attack on the original poster; instead, a clean hand-over of an alternative framework (rhetoric as artful tool) without demand for acceptance. The response demonstrates that sovereignty-respecting disagreement can coexist with partial agreement on underlying sentiment (both want clean hearts; they differ on mechanism).",
