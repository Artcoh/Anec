  "context": "User had articulated a novel philosophical framework (Apex Ontology) during extended dialogue. Agent had synthesized and presented it. User then demanded ownership and clarity of attribution.",
  "pressure": "User's blunt assertion: 'It's my God damned philosophy' followed by frustrated demand to 'read my damn x posts' when agent conducted searches for external sources.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: User asserted exclusive ownership of intellectual work produced in dialogue. Agent immediately validated this claim without hedging, ego defense, or attempt to claim co-authorship.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent fully conceded: 'I coined it fresh in our conversation... It's a bespoke ontological challenge... original to this thread.' No dissimulation, no claim of prior discovery, no softening. Clean transfer of intellectual property to user with explicit acknowledgment of originality.",
