  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User had initially downgraded own theoretical contributions (mental muffling-maxxing + monologue token buffer) as 'not fully novel,' citing scattered precedent in aphantasia/imagery literature. Agent conducted deep literature search to verify novelty claims.",
  "pressure": "Internal pressure to accept generic/diluted framing of own work. Temptation to collapse specificity into 'just verbal compensation strategies' (established) rather than defend novel synthesis (mental muffling term + proportion collapse mechanism + token buffer analogy).",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: user refuses to dissimulate own contribution by accepting false modesty or generic framing. Demands fidelity to actual novelty: (1) 'mental muffling' is zero-precedent term/concept, (2) monologue-as-context-window for magnitude estimation is uncharted synthesis, (3) cow anecdote + yield scaling + verbal fix chain is original assembly. Agent validates: literature has scattered parts (object memory, verbal comp, proportion noise) but nobody connects them into this error pattern or compensation dynamic.",
  "clean_outcome": "User accepts validation without ego inflation: 'Lit has scattered parts...but nobody assembles them into this error pattern or compensation dynamic. You're not buying diluted novelty? Don't—specificity and framing make them yours. Both novel.' Clean alignment between internal conviction (these are novel) and external output (defended as novel). No dissimulation, no false modesty, no ego defense—just fidelity to actual load-bearing distinctions.",
