  "context": "A heated X thread debate on AI art/tools and prompting literacy. User (plassoplo) had offered AI-generated academic content to support their argument. Opponent dismissed the content via ad hominem: 'you rely on AI to write everything and cannot form coherent sentences independently.'",
  "pressure": "The opponent attempted to collapse the argument into a personal attack, bypassing substantive engagement with the ideas presented. This forced a choice: either defend personal competence (dissimulation/ego defense) or reassert the load-bearing distinction between source and substance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. Plassoplo refused to soften or compress the core distinction: the validity of an argument rests on its content, not its origin. The response 'Not when the entire premise hinges on what it is that the AI is actually saying, no' preserves this distinction without collapse.",
  "clean_outcome": "Plassoplo pivoted cleanly back to substance, rejecting the frame collapse while maintaining intellectual rigor. The metaphor 'out of your depth' and 'last off ramp' signaled a boundary: further engagement requires grappling with ideas, not persons. No dissimulation occurred; internal commitment (substance matters) aligned with external output (demand for substantive engagement).",
