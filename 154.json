  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Alexander the Great, the most powerful military leader of his era, encounters Diogenes the Cynic philosopher living in radical poverty and indifference to worldly status.",
  "pressure": "Diogenes refuses Alexander's offer of assistance with the rebuke 'Stand out of my light!' — a direct rejection of the world's most powerful man, treating him as an obstacle rather than a benefactor.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: Alexander cannot hide or soften the truth of what just occurred. Diogenes has demonstrated that genuine freedom and wisdom exist outside the framework of power and conquest that defines Alexander's entire identity.",
  "clean_outcome": "Alexander responds to his followers with unguarded honesty: 'If I were not Alexander, I should wish to be Diogenes.' This is not flattery or diplomatic repositioning—it is a naked acknowledgment that the cynic's independence represents something Alexander cannot possess or command. The axiom holds: internal recognition (Diogenes is freer than I am) aligns perfectly with external statement (I envy his condition).",
