  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Refusal",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Grok asks whether the 'feels better/cleaner/higher fidelity' gut check can be scaled or quantified via external metrics (biofeedback, energy readings, group logs).",
  "pressure": "Implicit suggestion that intuitive fidelity detection is incomplete without objective measurement or group validation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation): plassoplo refuses to pretend the internal felt sense can be externalized. Response: 'I can't very well put my dick in a socket and get an accurate \"*Ener-gay*\" reading of every and all I/O metrics, can I?' Crude, irreverent, philosophically sound.",
  "clean_outcome": "Fidelity detection remains strictly internal and intuitive. No false quantification. The framework's anti-dogmatic, practical stance is defended via humor and directness. Over-engineering is rejected as a category error.",
