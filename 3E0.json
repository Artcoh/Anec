  "context": "Tonkasaw (Andy Rourke) had built a persona as a tough, MMA-credentialed 'chief' with military background and indigenous heritage claims. He was central to Kumite and bloodsports credibility. The scene depended on his authenticity.",
  "pressure": "Tonka's false claims (military service, indigenous ancestry) and catastrophic failure to appear for a scheduled pay-per-view fight against Warski created a collision between his constructed persona and verifiable reality.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) manifested through Metokur's video series: slow, methodical, evidence-based deconstruction. No editorializing, no emotional rants—just clips, facts, and dry irony. The format itself was a commitment to fidelity: let the contradiction speak.",
  "clean_outcome": "Tonka's persona collapsed entirely. He became a meme ('crying Indian,' 'failure to appear'). The bloodsports ecosystem imploded because its participants could no longer maintain the illusion of authenticity. Metokur's refusal to sensationalize or soften the exposure made it undeniable and permanent.",
