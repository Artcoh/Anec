  "title": "Alexander's Sovereignty Test: Diogenes Rebuke and Honest Admission",
  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Historical",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Alexander the Great, at the apex of military power and imperial authority, encounters Diogenes the Cynic philosopher lying in the sun. Alexander approaches with his retinue, offering to grant any wish Diogenes desires.",
  "pressure": "Diogenes responds with radical indifference: 'Stand out of my light.' This is a direct refusal to acknowledge Alexander's power, status, or generosity. The pressure is existential—Alexander's entire identity rests on being obeyed and admired; Diogenes obliterates both.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates. Alexander cannot pretend the rebuke didn't happen or reframe it as respect. He must align his internal recognition of Diogenes's superior freedom with external acknowledgment. He does: 'If I were not Alexander, I should wish to be Diogenes.' This is not flattery or spin—it is honest admission of a hierarchy Alexander cannot occupy.",
  "clean_outcome": "Alexander speaks truth to his followers without ego defense. He acknowledges that Diogenes possesses something he cannot: absolute sovereignty over his own desires and indifference to power. No dissimulation, no retaliation, no reframing. Clean transfer of respect.",
