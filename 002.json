  "context": "In a Twitter thread about disciplined activism, @plassoplo advocated filtering out hate and emotional rhetoric from organizing efforts. Another user (@megalurk5835) challenged this by boasting about their military credentials and skills, attempting to establish authority through personal credentials rather than engaging with the strategic argument.",
  "pressure": "Direct personal challenge to authority via credential-flexing and implicit questioning of @plassoplo's qualifications to speak on military-style discipline in activism",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation activated - rather than engage in ego defense or credential competition, @plassoplo maintained alignment between internal assessment (this is unproductive posturing) and external response",
  "clean_outcome": "Responded with sarcastic dismissal: 'That's great. Good luck being revolutionary' - effectively disengaging from ego-driven confrontation while maintaining the core position that emotional discipline trumps personal bravado in effective organizing",
