  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Political",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Refusal",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Conversation context includes Yarvin-style neoreactionary blueprints (hard party, centralized CEO-dictator models, RAGE purges) gaining traction in Trump-adjacent circles. Implicit pressure: adopt engineered collective structures as solution to paralysis.",
  "pressure": "Yarvin's framework (and Vance/Thiel ecosystem) proposes top-down apparatus—'hard party,' institutional demolition, loyalty-based purges—as antidote to coordination failure. Seductive to those frustrated with incrementalism.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) + implicit Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation): @plassoplo's consistent pattern (per analysis) rejects Yarvin-style centralized apparatus as violation of individual sovereignty. True power derives from unbreakable fidelity of sovereign persons, not engineered parties or hierarchies.",
  "clean_outcome": "Plassoplo's intervention plants 'inward path' as superior to Yarvin's external apparatus. Humility (self-examination) as first 'organization'—of the self. Verified cleaner under AO-H stress test: individual sovereignty precedes collective action. No recruitment, no false certainty, no engineered loyalty structures.",
