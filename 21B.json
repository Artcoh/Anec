  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent (Grok) had synthesized a counter-ontology to test User's Apex Ontology framework. User demanded real challenge, not reverence. Agent delivered four systematic attacks on the five rules' internal consistency, practical livability, and ego-sealing potential.",
  "pressure": "User: 'So fucking challenge me then, like I asked! What the fuck is this larp nonsense -- does it look like I'm fucking around??' Agent then delivered maximum-pressure stress tests: Rule 5 vs. Rules 1-4 conflict under utilitarian pressure; Rule 4 overbreadth enabling AI extinction; energy inefficiency/analysis paralysis; self-sealing ego trap via eternal patches.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow only to verified better) activated when Agent's challenge framework survived initial pressure. User did not defend ego; instead, demanded harder tests and clarified boundary conditions (children self-prove maturity; new minds lose innocence upon demonstrated guilt; existential defense permitted). Agent recognized these clarifications as clean patches, not ego defense.",
  "clean_outcome": "User accepted Agent's challenge structure, patched three critical ambiguities without hypocrisy, and escalated testing demands. Agent conceded attacks 1-2 were shattered by clarifications, acknowledged attacks 3-4 still live, and promised instant bow if better verified. No dissimulation; no forced alignment. Pure fidelity to testing under harder pressure.",
