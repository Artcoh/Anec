  "context": "Internet Bloodsports era (2017-2018): Streamers like Andy Warski and Tonkasaw built audiences through long-form debate content, creating parasocial bonds with viewers. Participants began treating online relationships as genuine friendships, conflating audience loyalty with actual camaraderie.",
  "pressure": "Multiple figures (Warski, Tonka, others) attempted to invoke 'bro code' and personal loyalty during escalating drama, treating Metokur as part of an in-group rather than an external observer.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: Metokur refused the forced role assignment. His response—'No, man. I'm not your friend. This is the internet'—reasserted his autonomy and rejected the parasocial frame entirely. He maintained distance, clarity, and refusal to be conscripted into their emotional ecosystem.",
  "clean_outcome": "The statement became legendary precisely because it exposed the illusion without cruelty. It functioned as a filter: those who understood the distinction between observer and participant survived; those who needed the friendship narrative collapsed. Metokur walked away unburdened, his mind intact.",
