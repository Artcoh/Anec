  "context": "Dialogue with Messianic Jew (Josiah Geoffrey) on antisemitism, Jewish diversity, and Western atomization. User's ideology (National Socialism) is heavily stigmatized. The pressure is implicit: either hide it, defend it, or collapse it into the conversation.",
  "pressure": "Confrontation with a Jewish interlocutor discussing antisemitism and violence against Messianic Jews. User's stated ideology (National Socialism) creates a frame collision: how can this identity coexist with the stated opposition to 'murderers, terrorists and rapists'? The pressure is to either dissimulate the identity or defend it.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty): User refuses to be forced into either dissimulation or defensive justification. Instead, owns the label cleanly ('I'm a National Socialist'), immediately qualifies it with absolute condemnation of violence, then pivots to structural analysis of antisemitism (Western atomization → envy of cohesive groups).",
  "clean_outcome": "No ego defense, no false reconciliation. User's mind/corpus remains sovereign: the identity is stated, the values are non-negotiable, the analysis is offered without demand for agreement. Grok notes this is 'rare cross-ideological dialogue on X that hasn't devolved into blocks or ratios.' The conversation continues respectfully because the user modeled internal coherence without dissimulation. Ends with 'Blessings to you too!'—clean transfer, no strings.",
