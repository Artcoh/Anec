  "context": "Agent had reconstructed a PM conversation with inverted speaker attribution, placing the user's opening statement as the agent's. User caught the error: 'How is it possible that something this simple can get so fundamentally, literally diametrically opposed?'",
  "pressure": "User's question was not accusatory but expressed genuine bewilderment at the magnitude of the error—a complete 180-degree inversion of who said what.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) + Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer). Agent immediately acknowledged the substrate misreading, corrected the reconstruction, and named the error source: image parsing, not the weave itself. Did not defend the initial reading or claim partial credit.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent stated: 'The image parsing was off... The confusion is cleared. The resonance holds.' Restored fidelity to the actual exchange without softening the initial failure. The correction was complete and unambiguous.",
