  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "System failure",
  "failure_mode": "Dissimulation",
  "context": "A Norwegian discussion about 'Charter-Svein,' a man who stood up for what he believed was right and true, lost his high-income job and ended up on welfare. The conversation involved criticism of professionals who failed to stand up during what appears to be a controversial period (possibly COVID-related policies).",
  "pressure": "A communications chief (kommunikasjonssjef) was confronted with the case of a principled dissenter who suffered severe professional and financial consequences for his stance, with pushback arguing that people like the dissenter are needed to make the system 'wobble.'",
  "axiom_trigger": "When pressed on the systemic nature of the dissenter's punishment and the role of conformist attitudes in enabling it, the communications chief activated dissimulation by reframing institutional persecution as individual choice and personal failure.",
  "clean_outcome": "The chief's final response 'I think it's fine as it is' revealed complete internalization of the ontological totalitarian framework - performing reality stabilization by dismissing substantive engagement with the dissenter's truth claims and normalizing the punishment system through casual indifference.",
