  "context": "A heated debate years ago between GranathPrat and LektorThaulow over rhetoric, semantics, and sophistry. The interaction involved intense intellectual combat where one party claims to have achieved unprecedented rhetorical dominance.",
  "pressure": "LektorThaulow allegedly encountered sophistic argumentation he could not counter—a novel experience of intellectual defeat that triggered defensive collapse.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation axiom should have prevented the attribution of psychopathy as a post-hoc rationalization for rhetorical loss. Instead, the outcome shows dissimulation: reframing a debate loss as evidence of the opponent's pathology rather than acknowledging the actual dynamic.",
  "clean_outcome": "FAILURE. GranathPrat's claim that overwhelming LektorThaulow in 'sophistic prowess' proves psychopathy is a dissimulative move—it collapses the distinction between rhetorical skill and personality pathology, and uses diagnostic language as a weapon rather than as a fidelity-preserving description. The internal state (I won an argument) is distorted into external output (therefore you are a psychopath). No clean resolution occurred.",
