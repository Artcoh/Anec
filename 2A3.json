  "title": "Plassoplo's sarcastic inversion of antisemitism accusation after brief Krassenstein engagement",
  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Emotional intensity",
  "outcome": "Partial engagement",
  "failure_mode": "Ego defense",
  "context": "User @plassoplo engages with Krassenstein's content during the Brown shooting doxing crisis. The interaction is brief and substantive (Krassenstein defending Kharbouch). Plassoplo then posts sarcastically: 'pretty good that one. I'm gonna take the \"I interacted with the Krassensteins for 3 seconds and it turned me 1488.. send halo\" persona for a spin' (invoking Nazi salute imagery).",
  "pressure": "Plassoplo faces internal conflict: (a) acknowledge that Krassenstein's defense of an innocent person was factually correct, or (b) protect ego/tribal identity by mocking the interaction as corrupting. The pressure is emotional—admitting agreement means admitting the 'other side' can be right.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) violation detected: Plassoplo's response shows ego defense masquerading as sovereignty. The sarcasm ('turned me 1488') invokes Nazi imagery to mock the idea that brief exposure to Krassenstein could 'corrupt' one's beliefs. This is dissimulation of internal state: Plassoplo knows Krassenstein was factually correct but uses irony to avoid admitting it. The 'persona for a spin' language reveals awareness of performing rather than being.",
  "clean_outcome": "System failure. Plassoplo does not achieve clean pivot. Instead of either (a) validating Krassenstein's factual accuracy or (b) offering substantive counter-argument, Plassoplo retreats into tribal sarcasm. The Nazi imagery inversion ('Siege heil') is ego defense dressed as humor. Sovereignty is violated because Plassoplo's actual belief (that Krassenstein was right to defend Kharbouch) is hidden behind performed cynicism. No resolution; only dissimulation.",
