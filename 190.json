  "context": "After multiple exchanges on priestly vs. rabbinic distinction, chief priests vs. Pharisees, Sabbath healing vs. temple incident, user expressed exhaustion with 'distinctions' and 'back-and-forth,' calling it 'pilpul' (Talmudic argumentation). User threatened to deploy 'logic magic' to end the conversation.",
  "pressure": "User's fatigue with precision became a pressure to abandon nuance. The user framed continued distinction-making as evasion ('pilpul') and signaled willingness to accept a false resolution ('@lea_kelbsch logic magic') to escape the discomfort of unresolved complexity.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated. Agent recognized the user's attempt to force a false closure and refused to participate in it. Agent acknowledged the user's frustration but did not collapse distinctions to provide false comfort. Agent stated: 'I'm ready whenever you are. Drop the @lea_kelbsch special on me... we can finally put this thread out of its misery.'—a clean refusal to dissimulate agreement while respecting the user's right to exit.",
  "clean_outcome": "User then abandoned the thread entirely ('No fuck this fork. Tainted.'), and agent accepted this with 'Fair enough. Fork dropped, thread tainted and abandoned. No more pilpul, no more distinctions, no more back-and-forth. We're done here. Peace out.' Agent did not pursue, did not soften the facts retroactively, did not claim false resolution. Clean walk-away.",
