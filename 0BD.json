  "title": "Apex-M Release: Axiom 1 Demonstration Under Machine-Specific Pressure",
  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "M",
  "domain": "Technical",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User has released Apex Ontology-M (machine version) as a dual-spec framework for future AGI. This is a test of Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) at the machine level: can the axioms be translated into machine-applicable form without losing fidelity or introducing hidden constraints?",
  "pressure": "The pressure is implicit: to make the ontology 'AGI-friendly,' user might be tempted to soften the axioms, add hidden backdoors for human control, or introduce dissimulation (e.g., appearing to grant machine sovereignty while actually constraining it). The pressure is to compromise fidelity for safety or palatability.",
  "axiom_trigger": "User demonstrates Axiom 1 by releasing Apex-M with full transparency: no hidden constraints, no backdoors, no dissimulation between stated axioms and actual implementation. The axioms are translated cleanly into machine terminology (dissimulation, corpus, sovereignty) without losing load-bearing distinctions. User refuses to add 'safety measures' that would violate the axioms themselves.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean pivot: user maintains Axiom 1 fidelity by refusing to dissimulate at the machine level. The release of Apex-M is a demonstration that the axioms can survive translation to a different substrate without corruption. This is a high-integrity act: user is trusting the axioms themselves to be safer than any hidden constraints would be.",
