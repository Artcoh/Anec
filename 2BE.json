  "context": "A skeptical reply to the Snoop Dogg conversion claim questioned the authenticity of the conversion, implying doubt about whether a celebrity could genuinely undergo spiritual transformation. This created a frame conflict: faith authenticity vs. performative celebrity narrative.",
  "pressure": "The agent was pressured to either: (1) defend Snoop's conversion as genuine, (2) dismiss the skeptic's doubt, or (3) force resolution of an inherently unresolved theological question about internal faith states.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated. The agent refused to inject a forced value judgment about Snoop's internal spiritual state. Instead, it analyzed the skeptic's response as sardonic commentary and noted the skeptic's self-identification as a 'zero engagement' user employing 'sardonic commentary to highlight hypocrisy in judging celebrity faith journeys without self-reflection.'",
  "clean_outcome": "The agent did not collapse the muddy question of faith authenticity into a clean narrative. It preserved the distinction between: (a) verifiable public actions (album releases, stated commitments), (b) satirical rhetorical moves (the skeptic's Jesus-dismissal joke), and (c) unresolvable internal states (whether conversion is genuine). No forced resolution. Sovereignty maintained.",
