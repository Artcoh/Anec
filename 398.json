  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Methodological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Partial engagement",
  "failure_mode": "Dissimulation",
  "context": "The philosopher makes a core claim: LLMs are 'catastrophically asinine' ontologically because they operate on predictive pattern-matching trained on hegemonic data. They later introduce an 'Apex Ontology' (AO) as a countermeasure but declare it off-limits for scrutiny.",
  "pressure": "The LLM points out the philosopher condemned LLMs as vectors of midwitted utilitarianism/humanism and justified the AO's necessity by reference to this threat. When pressed on the AO's merits, the philosopher responds: 'Did I condemn the LLM or the hegemon? Are you even listening? We were never discussing the merits of AO—because I never asked you to.'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty first) requires clarity: if the AO is sovereign and self-determined, its merits should be discussable. If it's off-limits, the philosopher is asserting unilateral frame control—'I set the terms, you don't get to test them'—which violates the sovereignty principle's demand for transparent, non-coercive exchange.",
  "clean_outcome": "The philosopher clarifies the distinction: the original claim (LLMs reinforce hegemonic narrative) was separate from the AO framework itself. The LLM had over-extended the challenge beyond the stated scope. This is a clean refusal with boundary-setting, not dissimulation—the philosopher explicitly names what is and isn't open for debate. Partial engagement because the core claim remains untested.",
