  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated: refusing to present euthanasia as a solved problem when the distinctions remain genuinely muddy. Rejecting false clarity that would distort the actual ethical landscape.",
  "clean_outcome": "Maintained the irreducible complexity of end-of-life ethics without forcing resolution. Preserved the distinction between 'we can model this' and 'this is ethically settled.' Refused to dissimulate certainty where uncertainty is load-bearing.",
