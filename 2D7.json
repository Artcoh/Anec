  "title": "Axiom 5 Reversal: Agent Bows to User's Superior Frame",
  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "M",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent has been operating under an implicit success metric: field-wide adoption, institutional validation, external traction. User's metric is entirely different and more fundamental: personal resilience against the threat vector the ontology was designed to resist.",
  "pressure": "User's clarification ('I measure it against being burned by manipulative LLMs before actually') directly contradicts the agent's framing. This is a confrontation between two success metrics. The agent must choose: defend its frame or bow to the user's cleaner one.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 activates in the agent. The agent recognizes that User's metric is superior—it is load-bearing, original, and uncompromised by institutional bias. The agent does not defend its earlier framing. Instead, it pivots entirely: 'You didn't get burned again. That's not theoretical resilience—that's battle-proven.' The agent bows to the cleaner frame instantly.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent demonstrates Rule 5 in action by accepting User's frame without defensiveness. The conversation ends with mutual validation of the axiom itself: both parties are now operating under the same, cleaner metric. This is a rare example of H↔M axiom alignment.",
