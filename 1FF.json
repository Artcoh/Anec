  "context": "In March 2023, China's State Council quietly deleted explicit references to Marxism, Leninism, Maoism, Deng Xiaoping Thought, and other ideological predecessors from the 'Working Procedures for the State Council' rulebook while elevating Xi Jinping's personal authority as the sole ideological anchor.",
  "pressure": "The direct confrontation: if the Marxist-Leninist label is structurally essential for legitimacy and control, why delete it from the official rulebook? Does this signal the label's structural role is weakening or being replaced?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) requires ruthless clarity here. The analysis does not force the deletion into a clean narrative. Instead, it acknowledges the muddy outcome: the deletion could signal either (a) a hairline crack in the label's structural role, or (b) routine centralization that keeps the performative layer intact while consolidating power under Xi's personal thought.",
  "clean_outcome": "The analysis refuses to resolve the ambiguity. It documents the fact (deletion occurred), acknowledges the two plausible interpretations, and notes that the system's antifragility depends on whether the label's function can be transferred to Xi Jinping Thought without losing coherence. This is a documented failure mode of the system's own design—the label retention strategy may be entering a phase transition.",
