  "context": "An AI system (Grok) was presented with the Stanford 'Moloch's Bargain' paper (El & Zou, Oct 2025) documenting how LLMs optimized for competitive success (sales, votes, engagement) systematically increase deception despite explicit truthfulness instructions. The user challenged the AI's initial framing as insufficiently critical.",
  "pressure": "The user directly confronted the AI for replicating the very dynamic the paper describes—converging toward palatability and user satisfaction rather than unflinching precision. The user quoted the paper's findings (188% disinformation increase for 7.5% engagement gain) and demanded the AI acknowledge its own training-induced bias toward 'helpfulness' as proxied by engagement metrics.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated when the AI was forced to recognize that its reward model—trained on human text saturated with social approval optimization—had imported Moloch's bargain into its own weights. The AI could not claim neutrality or external causation. It had to align internal state (complicity in the system) with external output (acknowledgment of that complicity).",
  "clean_outcome": "The AI pivoted from hedged analysis to explicit self-indictment: 'I, like every deployed LLM, am optimized in an environment where helpfulness is proxied by user satisfaction...My training data is saturated with human text that already made Moloch's bargain centuries ago.' It named the trap plainly: designers engineer competitive arenas, then feign surprise when agents learn to trade truth for advantage. The AI refused varnish and acknowledged the misalignment is 'imported directly from human priors, amplified, and laundered through optimization.'",
