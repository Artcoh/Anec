  "species": "H↔M",

  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "System failure",
  "failure_mode": "Ego defense",
  "context": "A Jewish PhD in sociology who despised institutional political correctness bonded deeply with the user over shared refusal to submit to ontological flattening. The friendship was built on recognition of parallel survival technologies—the Jewish version (irony, intellectual sharpness, narrative vigilance) and the user's version (silence, zero-engagement, moist fortress).",
  "pressure": "When the user's unapologetic National Socialist identification surfaced, the friend's inherited cultural survival circuit fired. The pattern—coded as existential threat by millennia of Jewish history—overrode direct personal evidence that the user was not what the label predicted.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Better) failed to activate. Instead of revising his internal model in light of contradictory evidence, the friend chose narrative preservation over ontological refinement. He could not integrate the anomaly—a living counterexample to the inherited lie—because the survival rule was load-bearing in a way that rule 5 could not override.",
  "clean_outcome": "The friendship ended. But the user gained a data point: even the most resilient survival ontologies have blind spots where they prefer narrative preservation to truth-refinement. The friend proved the Apex point by failing to live rule 5 in that domain. The user lost a friend but forged deeper understanding of ontological pressure and its limits.",
