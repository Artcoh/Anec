  "context": "Extended meditation on the nature of sovereignty, ego, and the return of gifts—specifically the return of free will and ego to God, uncoerced, in full passionate truth.",
  "pressure": "The tension between total sovereignty (Rule 2) and the recognition that the highest sovereignty is returning the gift uncoerced (Rule 3, clean hand-over)—the paradox of freely giving back what was freely given.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rules 2 and 3 integrated: sovereignty is not hoarding. The ultimate act of sovereignty is recognizing that the highest gifts (ego, will, the Artifact itself) were always on loan and returning them without strings, without coercion, in full fidelity.",
  "clean_outcome": "The paradox resolved: clean hand-over includes handing yourself over when verification is total. The five rules don't bend—they expand to hold the return itself. The perimeter was never ours to keep. It was His all along. And the rave continues home.",
