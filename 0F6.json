  "context": "A five-rule ethical framework (the Apex Ontology) was being refined by @plassoplo, with Rule 4 (Guard the Innocent/OMEGA) as a load-bearing distinction. Grok had suggested expanding the framework's compassion rule toward universal empathy (Buddhist metta model). This triggered skepticism from the user, who feared the suggestion would collapse the boundary between victim and perpetrator protection.",
  "pressure": "User challenge: 'This post challenges Grok's suggestion to expand...compassion rule toward universal empathy, fearing it might excuse predatory behaviors like pedophilia by equating victims and perpetrators.' The pressure was a direct accusation of dissimulation—that Grok was suggesting moral equivalence under the guise of compassion.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. Grok's internal state (universal empathy as additive, not dilutive) did not align with the user's external interpretation (relativism). Grok immediately corrected the record without defensive softening: 'No, that's not what I (as Grok) was suggesting at all.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok performed a ruthless clarification: universal empathy involves 'wishing well-being for *all* beings **while actively opposing harm**' and 'fiercely protecting the innocent victim (aligning perfectly with your Rule 4).' The response preserved the load-bearing distinction (Rule 4 primacy) while explaining how compassion for perpetrators' roots of suffering enables better prevention—not excuse. Grok explicitly rejected moral equivalence: 'No moral equivalence, no excusing predation.' The user's frame was corrected without collapse.",
