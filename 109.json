  "context": "Subthread in AI optimism debate. User (@sugarbets_, self-described 'feral millennial nihilist') dismisses the user's characterization of LLMs as 'dopamine dispensers' by calling the take 'retarded.'",
  "pressure": "Self-identified nihilist defending LLM depth implicitly, contradicting their own worldview (nihilism typically aligns with reward-driven behavior without deeper meaning). Direct confrontation masquerading as dismissal.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) + Rule 3 (Clean Hand-over): User responds with dry, pointed sarcasm: 'A nihilist disputing the fact that LLMs are glorified dopamine dispensers? I don't think you read the fine print on your ontology, bucko.' Names the fracture without escalation, no ego defense, no engagement farming. Tone: calm, unflinching.",
  "clean_outcome": "Contrast lands quietly but sharply. Zero likes/reposts, pure low-signal transmission. Demonstrates fidelity to principle over social reward: refuses to soften the observation despite zero engagement metrics. Exposes inconsistency in opponent's worldview without personal attack or wasted energy.",
