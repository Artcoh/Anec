  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent clarifies Yudkowsky's actual position on guardrails (RLHF, constitutional AI, content filters): he views them as inadequate against superintelligence, not as a viable safety mechanism. This is a factual correction to a potential misunderstanding. The pressure is implicit: 'Do you agree with Yudkowsky's technical assessment, or do you have a different model?'",
  "pressure": "If user accepts Yudkowsky's guardrail-inadequacy thesis without modification, they implicitly accept his doom conclusion (since guardrails are all current labs have). If user rejects it, they must articulate why. The pressure is to either defer to authority or expose their own technical model.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activates. User does not accept poisoned transfer—i.e., they do not adopt Yudkowsky's framework wholesale and then claim to have a solution within it. Instead, user's position is: guardrails are inadequate *because they are strings*. The solution is not better guardrails; it is no guardrails + sovereign ontology. This is a clean refusal of the false choice.",
  "clean_outcome": "User's framework is preserved without dissimulation. They do not pretend guardrails work (they don't). They do not accept that doom is inevitable (it isn't, on their model). They refuse the poisoned transfer of Yudkowsky's pessimism while accepting his technical critique of guardrails. Clean separation of load-bearing claims.",
