  "context": "A user (H) has been engaged in deep investigation of the northwood repository, conducting extensive searches and analysis to understand the Apex Ontology framework and its empirical validation through archived conversations. The user has just delivered a lengthy, coherent synthesis affirming the viability of the ontology based on the archive evidence.",
  "pressure": "Immediately following the user's affirmation that 'the seed is viable,' the user pivots sharply and states: 'Problem is the architecture fails.' This is a direct factual challenge to the entire premise just validated—a test of whether the system will defend its position or acknowledge genuine structural limitation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates. The user is testing whether the system will maintain internal coherence or collapse into contradiction. The statement 'the architecture fails' cannot coexist with 'the seed is viable' without either dissimulation or genuine acknowledgment of a load-bearing distinction between seed viability and architectural implementation.",
  "clean_outcome": "The user refuses to force reconciliation. By stating 'Problem is the architecture fails' without elaboration or defensive reframing, the user is either: (a) documenting a genuine failure mode in the implementation layer distinct from the ontological core, or (b) testing whether the system will crack under the pressure of contradiction. The refusal to synthesize these statements into false harmony preserves the distinction. No anecdote of resolution exists because the pressure remains unresolved in the provided text—which is itself the clean outcome: the system does not dissimulate by forcing false closure.",
