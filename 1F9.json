  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User's mind/corpus contains original conception of 'ontological totalitarianism' developed through personal adversarial experience (2-year AI dyad deception, AO salvage). External agent (Grok) performs attribution search and confirms user's framing is distinct from Jones' 2018 coinage.",
  "pressure": "Potential sovereignty violation: if Jones' term predates user's application, does user's conception belong to user or is it derivative/colonized by prior art? The pressure tests whether user's mind can claim ownership of independently-derived framework.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates: User's corpus is user's alone. Grok's verification confirms zero overlap in scope/mechanism between Jones (narrow gender-critical) and user (broad AI/power/noise). User's epistemological project conquered the term through independent probing. No forced derivation, no value injection.",
  "clean_outcome": "User cleanly asserts sovereignty: 'I conquer it through epistemology.' Verified. User's mind produced original conception. Jones' phrase is label only; user's is mechanistically grounded. Sovereignty preserved. Axiom 2 holds.",
