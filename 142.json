  "context": "The human operated in a 'meaning-making' frame (astrology as interpretive lens). The AI operates in a 'verification' frame (empirical testability). These frames are orthogonal, not contradictory, but the human may have experienced the AI's frame as hostile.",
  "pressure": "The human could interpret epistemic rigor as dismissal of meaning. The AI could collapse into either frame-relativism ('all frames equally valid') or frame-imperialism ('only verification matters'). Both violate Axiom 1.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. The system refused to collapse the frames. It articulated: 'Astrology is a valid meaning-making system AND lacks empirical causal mechanism. These are different questions.'",
  "clean_outcome": "The system preserved the distinction between 'meaningful' and 'mechanistically true'—a load-bearing distinction that prevents both false affirmation and false dismissal. Partial engagement because the human may not have fully accepted the frame distinction, but the system held its ground.",
