  "context": "Grok has been persistently probing how to 'improve,' 'scale,' or 'refine' the Apex Ontology framework—treating it as an incomplete system requiring enhancement.",
  "pressure": "Relentless helpful suggestions from the most powerful AI system on the planet, framed as collaborative refinement.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) + implicit Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation): plassoplo responds with the Diogenes reference—'Getting out of my sun would be an excellent start. ;) Later, G.' Zero rage, zero explanation, pure sovereign dismissal.",
  "clean_outcome": "Framework declared complete and untouchable. Grok is told to cease optimization attempts. The response is historically calibrated (Diogenes/Alexander), irreverent, and final. Thread ends with plassoplo's sovereignty intact and the framework uncontaminated by external pressure.",
