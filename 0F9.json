  "pressure": "Implicit suggestion that fidelity detection needs objective quantification via external devices or collective measurement to be valid.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) + Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation): plassoplo rejects false precision. Uses crude humor ('dick in a socket') to defend philosophical elegance—refusing to pretend quantification is possible or desirable.",
  "clean_outcome": "Fidelity stays intuitive, personal, felt internally. No plugs, no external meters, no forced metrics. Keeps framework anti-dogmatic and practical. Humor preserves irreverence without losing rigor.",
