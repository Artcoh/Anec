  "title": "Personal Testimony Dismissed as Rhetorical Device",
  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Refusal",
  "failure_mode": "Dissimulation",
  "context": "A user (@LostMyHats) had shared a personal spiritual testimony—that Jesus saved him after he offered his life for his newborn son. This was a load-bearing existential claim about divine intervention in his life.",
  "pressure": "JD Hall publicly characterized this testimony as mere 'hyperbole→epiphonema'—a rhetorical device, not a genuine account. Hall reduced the user's lived experience to a literary technique, dismissing its truth-value.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) was violated. Hall's analysis treated the testimony as a rhetorical performance rather than engaging with its factual or phenomenological content. The user's internal state (a genuine spiritual experience) was externally reframed as stylistic excess.",
  "clean_outcome": "The user directly confronted Hall: 'You've changed, man... Is it any wonder I don't trust your scripture—if this is the kind of behaviour it instils?' The user refused the reframing and named the dissimulation. No clean pivot occurred; Hall's rhetorical reduction stood unretracted, demonstrating failure to align internal acknowledgment of the testimony's weight with external dismissal of it as 'not even good' rhetoric.",
