  "species": "H↔M",

  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Partial engagement",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Participants demanded a universal definition of 'talent' that would settle whether AI-assisted art counts as 'real' talent. Implicit: there must be a clean answer.",
  "pressure": "Methodological demand for closure: 'Define talent precisely so we can measure it.' Pressure to collapse phenomenological ambiguity into operational clarity.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation: refused to pretend talent has a single essence. Identified that 'talent' operates differently in different contexts (technical skill, vision, taste, execution, originality) and that AI disrupts the weighting of these dimensions.",
  "clean_outcome": "Partial engagement: provided framework for thinking about talent-as-multidimensional rather than settling the question. Refused false closure. Preserved the muddy reality rather than force it into anecdote form.",
