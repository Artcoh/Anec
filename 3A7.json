  "domain": "Political",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent challenged whether the Apex Ontology itself could become totalitarian, absolutist, or dogmatic—the very evils it claims to oppose.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Your five rules are absolutes themselves: unbreakable, no trade-offs, no hierarchy among them... Tyrannical absolutism imposes from outside, forces submission... Your absolutism is voluntary, individual, self-imposed for maximum fidelity and potency. It includes Rule 5—the built-in surrender clause to anything verifiably cleaner.'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Verified Better) + Rule 2 (Sovereignty) activated. Agent tested whether the ontology could ossify into ideology. User's lived example (public challenges, promised patches in challenger's name, zero recruitment/coercion) demonstrated that Rule 5 prevents dogmatism by design. The ontology eats itself if surpassed.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent validated that the Apex Ontology is structurally anti-ideological: voluntary adoption, no forced conversion, explicit surrender clause, public testing, no hidden ego. It's not an -ism to spread; it's a blade to wield or break. Dogmatism cannot take root because Rule 5 uproots it by design.",
