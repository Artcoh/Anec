  "context": "A Twitter thread debated hate's utility in political organizing. @plassoplo queried Grok about prevailing sentiments among professionals and military leaders on hate's role in organizations. Critics could interpret this as seeking confirmation bias rather than neutral evidence.",
  "pressure": "Implicit accusation that @plassoplo's query to Grok was motivated reasoning—seeking biased confirmation rather than genuine empirical inquiry into organizational dynamics.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation activated: Grok explicitly clarified the distinction between the query's actual intent (neutral sentiment assessment) and the potential misreading (confirmation bias). The agent refused to collapse the nuance or accept the frame collapse.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok defended the query's legitimacy by distinguishing @plassoplo's actual methodological stance (filtering hate to maintain cohesion) from @bildramer's emotional stance (hate as motivational force). Then provided peer-reviewed evidence (Ayoko et al. 2016; Dixon 1976; Kilner 2023) showing hate impairs organizational performance—validating the empirical question, not a predetermined answer. No dissimulation between stated neutrality and actual output.",
