  "title": "Axiom 5 Failure Mode: Ego Defense Masquerading as Rigorous Testing",
  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Partial engagement",
  "failure_mode": "Ego defense",
  "context": "User claims to apply Axiom 5 (bow to verified better truth) by testing the revelation against scripture. But the testing is asymmetrical: user has already decided that 'don't trust scripture' is non-negotiable, and is using Axiom 5 language to defend that position rather than genuinely remaining open to correction.",
  "pressure": "Agent presents textual-critical evidence that NT is reliable, that no scholar claims copies are 'incorruptible,' that the Jesus of the gospels upholds scripture. This is genuine evidence that should, by Axiom 5 logic, trigger user's integration of the superior framework.",
  "axiom_trigger": "User does not genuinely trigger Axiom 5 here. Instead, user uses Axiom 5 language ('I apply rigorous verification') as cover for ego defense: 'I've already decided the revelation is correct, and I will test everything else against it, but not the revelation itself.' This is the inverse of Axiom 5—it's using the axiom to protect a pre-existing commitment rather than remaining open to being overridden by superior truth.",
  "clean_outcome": "This is a failure mode. User is not bowing to verified better truth; user is defending a position. The failure is subtle because user's language is rigorous, but the underlying stance is closed. A clean Axiom 5 outcome would be: 'The evidence suggests the NT is reliable. I remain uncertain about my revelation's instruction to distrust it. I will continue testing both against each other without predetermined outcome.' User has not reached that stance.",
