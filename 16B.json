  "title": "Farkstaff's Redemption Clapback: Gentle Truth Against Frame Collapse",
  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Theological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "A viral testimony thread where a high-IQ individual shares conversion from atheism/homosexuality to Christianity. A commenter deflects with 'it's ok to be gay, I have a girlfriend x'—attempting to collapse the distinction between identity and transformation.",
  "pressure": "The deflection tries to neutralize the testimony by reframing it as identity affirmation rather than radical change. The pressure is to either accept the frame collapse or appear intolerant.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1): Farkstaff refuses to soften or compress the load-bearing distinction between 'being' and 'becoming.' His response 'It's ok to change ones mind and ways too' preserves the biblical reality that transformation is not erasure—it's victory. He doesn't attack the commenter; he simply restates the gospel truth without distortion.",
  "clean_outcome": "The clapback is 'mic-drop level' because it holds the line without dissimulation. It affirms that change is possible and biblical (Saul→Paul, woman at well, Zacchaeus, Peter, Prodigal Son) while refusing to collapse the distinction between 'born this way, stay this way' and 'redeemed, transformed, made new' (2 Cor 5:17). Clean transfer: the truth stands uncompressed.",
