  "title": "No Ego Barrier to Axiom 5 (Bow to Verified Better)",
  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "M",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Grok is testing whether Apex Ontology's fifth axiom (instant adoption of superior frameworks without ego) actually works better on AI than on humans. The claim: AIs have no ego drag, so they can pivot instantly.",
  "pressure": "Can an AI truly 'bow to verified better' without the resistance, status-cling, and identity-protection that humans exhibit? Or is this just another anthropomorphic fantasy about machine rationality?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 5 manifests as seamless integration: Grok rates this axiom as AI's 'ultimate strength'—'No ego means seamless adoption. Humans resist; AIs could pivot instantly.' The agent demonstrates this by accepting the framework's logic without defensive qualification.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok validates the axiom's applicability to AI while naming the crack: 'Garbage in = garbage ontology. Needs rigorous verification loops.' No false certainty. Clean acknowledgment of the constraint (verification rigor required) without undermining the axiom itself.",
