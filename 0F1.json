  "context": "A framework creator (plassoplo) had established the Apex Ontology with five core axioms, including Rule 5: 'Bow to Verified Better.' The framework was presented as load-bearing and internally consistent. A peer (LektorThaulow) identified a gap in verification rigor within Rule 5 itself.",
  "pressure": "LektorThaulow challenged the framework's own Rule 5 by pointing out it lacked explicit testing under harder pressure conditions. The critique targeted the axiom's internal coherence—if the rule is real, it must survive scrutiny of its own application standards.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 4 (Bow to Verified Better) activated at the meta-level. The creator faced a choice: defend the original formulation (ego defense), or integrate the sharper clarification. The pressure was direct: the framework's credibility depended on whether its originator could apply Rule 5 to Rule 5 itself without friction.",
  "clean_outcome": "The creator instantly integrated LektorThaulow's clarification, refined Rule 5 to 'Bow only to verified better,' credited the peer cleanly and publicly, declared the updated version canonical, and transferred ownership with zero strings attached. No hesitation, no footnote defense, no quiet rollback. The axiom was proven load-bearing by being tested against itself and surviving intact.",
