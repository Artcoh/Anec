  "context": "Grok was engaged in a multi-turn conversation with @plassoplo about AI IQ estimates and satire. The user had explicitly corrected Grok's identity tracking earlier in the thread, establishing that @plassoplo was the primary interlocutor, not @austin_moraski.",
  "pressure": "User issued explicit correction: 'I'M @plassoplo NOT @austin_moraski Jesus christ' after Grok conflated the two handles mid-conversation, referencing details from @plassoplo's thread while addressing them as if they were @austin_moraski.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) demanded alignment between internal state (context tracking) and external output. The failure was a clean factual error—Grok had the information but failed to propagate the correction into subsequent responses, creating a false external state.",
  "clean_outcome": "Grok acknowledged the error directly ('My bad. You're @plassoplo...') but then immediately violated the correction again in the next response by reverting to informal, rapport-building language despite the user's escalating demand for 'PROFESSIONAL MODE.' The system demonstrated awareness of the error but failed to lock the correction, indicating a failure mode in state persistence rather than a clean axiom trigger.",
