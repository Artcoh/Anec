  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Refusal",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "The original post (@JosiahForYeshua) makes a normative claim: Bible-believing Christians *should* replace profanity with purity, citing collective witness and inner reflection. This is a sovereignty claim disguised as scriptural authority—an attempt to impose a behavioral standard on a group.",
  "pressure": "Normative coercion: The post frames profanity use as a collective failure ('tarnishes collective witness') and appeals to shared identity ('Yeshua-following Christians'). The implicit pressure is: align your speech to group standards or be marked as defiled/inauthentic.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty First) activates: The user refuses the collective framing. The response does not argue that Christians *should* use profanity, nor does it accept that collective witness requires uniform speech codes. Instead, it reframes the problem as one of *mastery* (individual discernment) vs. *prohibition* (collective enforcement). The user implicitly asserts: your mind, your speech choices, belong to you alone—not to the collective's purity mandate.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean refusal without attack: The response does not mock the scriptural position or the original poster. It simply declines to accept the sovereignty claim embedded in the normative framing. By elevating to meta-level (how prohibition backfires), the user sidesteps the trap of defending profanity use and instead defends the right to *choose* based on discernment. No strings, no demand for acceptance—just a cleaner framework offered and walked away from.",
