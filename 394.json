  "context": "User engaged with an AI system providing balanced evidence on whether AI is narrowing the gap to human-like intuition. The system presented both pro-narrowing evidence (emergent introspection, world models, theory of mind) and counter-evidence (deception, misinformation loops, overhype, no true consciousness). User had sovereignty over the frame.",
  "pressure": "The user faced a choice: accept the balanced synthesis (which risks legitimizing hype) or reject the entire framing as complicit in distortion. The pressure was epistemological—how to hold truth without being captured by either techno-optimism or reflexive skepticism.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated. The user stated: 'I think I wrote something about that the other day: \"Overhype and Ethical Harms.\" And I try and focus on Human underhype.' This is a clean assertion of independent judgment. The user refused to be bound by the system's frame (narrowing gap vs. compounding distortions) and instead claimed ownership of a distinct analytical lens: the underhype of human capacity, intuition, and judgment.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean pivot. The user did not dissimulate agreement or pretend the balanced evidence resolved the tension. Instead, they walked away from the binary and staked their own territory: focusing on what AI discourse systematically underhypes—human cognition, embodied wisdom, and the irreducible 'I' that no model can simulate. No strings attached; the user's mind remained their own.",
