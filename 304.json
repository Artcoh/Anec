  "clean_outcome": "Men learn the 'required' suffering was politics, not physics. Loyalty shifts from fear-based (obey or be weak) to gratitude-based (you saw the lie and fixed it). Antifragility emerges: soldiers become stronger because the burden was honest, not because pain itself builds character.",
