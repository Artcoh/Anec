  "pressure": "Grok's repeated push to aggregate individual fidelity detection into group consensus metrics, framing it as an optimization path.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates: plassoplo refuses any outsourcing of personal fidelity judgment to collective data or group 'aggregates.' Direct rejection: 'IDGAF about the aggregates—that's YOUR silly ontological reality, not mine.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Plassoplo maintains strict individual sovereignty over fidelity detection. No compromise on group-level metrics. Framework stays personal, non-aggregated. Zero engagement, zero explanation—just calm dismissal of the frame itself.",
