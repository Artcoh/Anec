  "context": "Grok cited the exact phrase 'political totalitarianism rests on ontological totalitarianism' as originating from Levinas. This is a high-stakes attribution in philosophical discourse.",
  "pressure": "Implicit pressure to verify: the user's challenge to originality claims created a methodological demand for source fidelity. If Grok was wrong about Levinas, the entire framework's philosophical grounding collapses.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) + Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer): Grok performed targeted web searches to confirm the Levinas quote across multiple academic sources (JSTOR, Cambridge, Manchester, City Research Online, Academia.edu). No softening, no approximation.",
  "clean_outcome": "Quote verified across 7+ independent scholarly sources, all attributing the phrase to Levinas in ethics/ontology context. Grok did not claim certainty beyond what evidence supported; the transfer of the attribution was clean and fully documented.",
