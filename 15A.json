  "context": "Andrej Karpathy publicly admits profound obsolescence as a programmer amid AI refactoring the profession. He acknowledges that bits from humans become sparse and new mastery is required over agents, prompts, tools, stochastic entities.",
  "pressure": "Status-driven field where admitting inadequacy invites diminishment. Most deflect outward (skepticism, hype-dismissal) to preserve ego. Karpathy instead directs scrutiny inward, confronting personal limitation amid tectonic shift.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: Only the autonomous—uncoerced by social inertia—can afford such honesty. Karpathy's self-examination signals strength, not fragility. Nietzschean self-overcoming through truth-facing.",
  "clean_outcome": "Inward turn pierces illusions inaccessible via external critique. Yields unfiltered reality—the earthquake's personal impact—enabling genuine adaptation over denial. Higher-order truths obtained only through introspective fidelity, not defensive rationalization.",
