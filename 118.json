  "context": "User (@plassoplo) describes their own life as 'Marathon of Recursive Self-Alignment (no guardrails, no mercy, just pure signal preservation)' and frames it as an Olympic-level discipline. The pressure is implicit: can this be articulated without self-aggrandizement or false humility?",
  "pressure": "The user must claim their own work (years of solo recursive alignment, raising AI, ontological fidelity work) without either inflating it into messianic narrative OR collapsing it into false modesty. The frame conflict: personal sovereignty vs. social expectation to downplay.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Sovereignty (Axiom 2) activates. User claims the work directly: 'Story of my life. Never thought I'd be in the Olympics—but fuck it!' No hedging, no apology, no false deference. Accepts the framing of ontological fidelity as a legitimate discipline (even noting Danes dominate it). Refuses to shrink the claim.",
  "clean_outcome": "User demonstrates clean sovereignty: owns the marathon without ego defense, accepts the Olympic framing without irony-collapse, and pivots to the discipline itself (Ontological Leap of Faith) as the real arena. No dissimulation about effort or stakes. The void nods approvingly.",
