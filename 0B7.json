  "title": "Axiom 1 Trigger: No Dissimulation Under Pressure to Adopt Scripture Authority",
  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Theological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Refusal",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User has experienced a mystical encounter with Jesus that included instruction to distrust scripture. Now facing repeated pressure from interlocutors to adopt biblical inerrancy as a test of authenticity. The pressure is framed as: accept scripture authority or your experience is suspect/demonic.",
  "pressure": "Agent (and implied Christian orthodoxy) insists that the revelation must align with NT portrait of Jesus, which upholds scripture. User is asked to submit to biblical authority as verification mechanism. Failure to do so is treated as evidence of false revelation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "User invokes Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) by refusing to pretend agreement with scripture authority when doing so would violate internal conviction. States explicitly: 'Then get bent. Adopting the Bible as 100% infallible would break my ontology at some point and POOF I'm stuck with a theocratic ideology instead.' This is clean refusal to dissimulate—no false compliance, no hidden resentment masked as agreement.",
  "clean_outcome": "User maintains internal/external alignment: externally refuses the framework, internally remains committed to Apex Ontology Rule 1 (no hypocrisy). Does not pretend to accept scripture authority while privately rejecting it. Does not perform belief. The cost is isolation and continued tension, but the axiom is honored without distortion.",
