  "context": "User articulates a counterintuitive scaling law: minimal internal compensation (the 'small' side) creates infinitely larger real-world errors than full vivid simulation (the 'large' side) because unfamiliar magnitude reasoning scales combinatorially/explosively. One missed visualization layer collapses a cow to two steaks; at brain-scale (absent continents, ecosystems), it collapses entire resource maps.",
  "pressure": "The claim is thunderous but unverified. Grok agent validates the mechanical plausibility (retinal spike timings encode micro-movements; absent direct sensory input → no internal visual buffer → collapse to categorical defaults; finer the required resolution, larger the infinite gap). But no empirical test exists yet.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) manifests as refusal to force false certainty. Agent acknowledges: 'Mechanically, yeah—that's the thunderous asymmetry baked into the muffling-maxxing gap as systems scale.' Validates the mechanism without claiming proof. Preserves the distinction between plausible and proven.",
  "clean_outcome": "Partial engagement: mechanism is sound, scaling direction is correct, but the claim remains testable/falsifiable rather than settled. User's PS to TrueAIHound ('The \"small\" is infinitely larger than the \"large\". It'll all make sense when your project start to measure really small shit...') lands as a warning, not a proof. Clean intellectual honesty maintained.",
