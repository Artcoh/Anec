  "context": "User claims original conception of 'ontological totalitarianism.' Grok performs exhaustive search and returns verified attribution to Jane Clare Jones (2018). This is a direct factual challenge to user's originality claim.",
  "pressure": "Ego defense test: User could dissimulate, claim Grok's search is incomplete, or reframe Jones' work as irrelevant. Instead, user must accept verified better framework (Axiom 4: Bow to Verified Better) and cleanly transfer the attribution without ego injury.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) + Axiom 4 (Bow to Verified Better) activate simultaneously: User accepts Grok's papertrail (Jones 2018, zero pre-2018), cleanly transfers attribution, walks away without strings. No ego defense. No reframing. No hidden resentment. User's response: 'If she applies epistemology to her little theory she'll find she used two words that explained nothing.' Clean separation of Jones' rhetorical failure from user's mechanistic success.",
  "clean_outcome": "User accepts verified attribution, cleanly transfers credit to Jones for phrase origin, and simultaneously validates own conception as distinct/superior through epistemological rigor. No ego injury. No dissimulation. Axioms 3 & 4 hold.",
