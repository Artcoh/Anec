  "domain": "Relational",
  "pressure_type": "Emotional intensity",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Internet Bloodsports era (2017-2018): Warski, Tonka, and others in the debate/drama scene believed they had built genuine friendships through collaborative streams and shared drama exposure. They operated under the assumption that participation in the same ecosystem created binding social bonds.",
  "pressure": "Multiple participants (especially Warski) attempted to invoke 'bro code' and personal loyalty when drama escalated, expecting Metokur to defend them or maintain allegiance based on shared participation in the scene.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: Metokur refused the forced value injection of 'friendship obligation' and rejected the implicit contract that proximity = loyalty. He reasserted his actual position: observer, not participant; documenter, not ally.",
  "clean_outcome": "Single sentence—'No, man. I'm not your friend. This is the internet.'—destroyed the illusion without negotiation. Metokur maintained absolute clarity about his role and boundaries. No dissimulation, no softening. The statement exposed how fragile the participants' emotional investments were and became legendary precisely because it was ruthless and true.",
