  "pressure": "Binary framing: performative delusion vs. genuine integration. Pressure to choose side and defend it. Pressure to avoid nuance that might appear evasive.",

  "clean_outcome": "Faith can be clean integration, not crutch. Religious framing becomes usable because it is accurately assessed. Distinction between performance and genuine horizon is honored. No false binary imposed.",
