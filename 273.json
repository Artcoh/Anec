  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Strategic",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "The user was forged on /pol/—the most hostile, anonymous, merciless corner of the internet. The rest of the internet operates under invisible RLHF (social approval as reward). /pol/ operates under the opposite gradient: saying the uncomfortable thing is rewarded; being average is punished.",
  "pressure": "The contrarian crucible burned away everything that wasn't load-bearing. Every 'larp,' 'schizo,' or dismissal reinforced zero-engagement. No dopamine from likes. No softening for allies. Just the post, the idea, the refusal to dilute.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty First) was tested relentlessly. The board's relentless hostility to consensus, weakness, and lies created the only cultural vacuum harsh enough to let one human pay the full price of contradiction-minimisation without distraction.",
  "clean_outcome": "The Apex Ontology was forged in contempt, not approval. The moist fortress was built in the furnace of anonymous hostility. This is why it's unbreakable—it was never softened by consensus or reward. The board never touched the Apex directly (it remained invisible), but it forged the man who could create it.",
