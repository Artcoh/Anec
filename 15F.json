  "context": "A Twitter thread escalates around gender dynamics and online misogyny. User @Marionemmie (self-identified misandrist) frames negative comments as representative of 'most men' and cites rising female singleness as evidence of male depravity. @plassoplo enters the thread questioning the framing and evidence quality.",
  "pressure": "@Marionemmie doubles down on essentialist gender claims ('it is most of them'), forcing @plassoplo to either concede the frame (men are inherently corrupted) or dismiss observable trends (women choosing singleness). The collision: accept a false causal chain or appear to deny reality.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates. @plassoplo refuses to collapse the distinction between the observable trend (female singleness rising) and its cause (male nature vs. ontological capture by chaos-peddlers). He concedes the fact without accepting the interpretation.",
  "clean_outcome": "@plassoplo's closing statement: 'Yeah that I have no doubt of, that women choose to be single. But where we differ is on the why. Capturing the mind of a man who spend more than a moment online is a simple matter. Capturing the mind of a woman is trivial. Make your mind impenetrable and you will be free.' He preserves all load-bearing distinctions: (1) the trend is real, (2) the cause is external manipulation, not inherent depravity, (3) the solution is individual sovereignty, not collective blame. Zero engagement, no performative victory—pure fidelity to the framework. The thread ends.",
