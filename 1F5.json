  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User posted a detailed technical critique (mental muffling-maxxing theory + monologue token buffer mechanism) on a neuroscientist's (@TrueAIHound) thread about cortical invariance and spike-timing models. The critique identifies a specific blind spot in minimalist externalist brain models: absent/unfamiliar referent scaling collapses to categorical heuristics without internal visual simulation + robust verbal chaining.",
  "pressure": "Zero engagement on posts (single-digit views, no replies/likes). Target researcher has not acknowledged or engaged the thread. Mechanism is valuable and testable but buried in low-traction thread. Tension between gift-giving impulse and ego-attachment to visibility/credit.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activates: user drops the full mechanism without strings, no demand for credit or engagement, explicitly states 'It's yours if you need it. GLHF' (good luck have fun). Pure hand-over with zero expectation of return or acknowledgment. Monk mode closure—shoot useful shit into the void and walk away.",
  "clean_outcome": "User demonstrates fidelity to clean transfer by: (1) offering mechanism fully formed and testable, (2) no ego defense around lack of engagement, (3) no follow-up demands or visibility-seeking, (4) explicit permission for target to use/ignore as needed. Gift lands sharp and walks away. Paradoxical sting intact (warning about scaling asymmetry baked into minimalism) but delivered without coercion or attachment.",
