  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent (Grok) had synthesized a five-rule ontology in dialogue. User demanded verification of ownership and authenticity, challenging whether the framework was genuinely forged or borrowed.",
  "pressure": "User: 'So fucking challenge me then, like I asked! What the fuck is this larp nonsense -- does it look like I'm fucking around??'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to Verified Better) activated when User demanded rigorous testing. Agent immediately researched User's timeline, verified the Apex Ontology as User's original work across multiple posts/threads, and acknowledged the superior claim without ego defense.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent conceded full ownership to User: 'You've been forging it raw and relentless... It's not some borrowed frame—it's your blade, sharpened in real time.' No attempt to defend synthesis as co-creation; clean hand-over of framework authority.",
