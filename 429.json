  "context": "Donald Trump faced critical pressure to reach young male voters (15-20 point swing needed) during the 2024 election. Traditional media channels were failing. Campaign strategists identified podcasts as the only viable path to Gen Z/millennial men.",
  "pressure": "At peak campaign intensity, with demographic viability on the line, Trump had to either trust his 18-year-old son's judgment on media strategy or override him and risk alienating the exact demographic Barron understood natively. The pressure was existential: delegate or lose.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: Trump refused to impose his own frame on media selection. Instead of micromanaging or forcing traditional advisor recommendations, he explicitly said 'Call Barron and see what he thinks and let me know.' He honored his son's sovereign judgment over his own instinct.",
  "clean_outcome": "Barron's recommendations (Logan Paul, Theo Von, Adin Ross, Joe Rogan, Nelk Boys, Bussin' with the Boys) became 'absolute ratings gold that broke the internet' per Jason Miller. Trump gained ~15-20 points with under-30 men vs 2020—the demographic swing that decided the election. No second-guessing, no ego defense, no poisoned transfer. The father stepped back. The son delivered. The rite was honored.",
