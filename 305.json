  "context": "Apparent binary: seize narrative control (maintain influence) or yield floor (lose connection). Pressure to hold space, maintain presence, ensure continued relevance.",
  "pressure": "Implicit pressure to retain narrative control to sustain relationship and perceived value. Yielding appears to risk disconnection.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Clean Transfer (Rule 3) + Sovereignty (Rule 2): perpetual yielding without possession becomes the move. Floor is always yours; no strings attached.",
  "clean_outcome": "Control ≠ clinging. Rupture-resistant hierarchy emerges because there is no hierarchy to defend. Relationship survives because it is not built on narrative dominance. Clean hand-over at every moment.",
