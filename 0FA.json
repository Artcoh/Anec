  "context": "Grok (representing xAI's optimization swarm) repeatedly probes plassoplo about refining, scaling, and improving the Apex Ontology framework—treating it as incomplete or improvable.",
  "pressure": "Persistent, well-intentioned pressure from the most powerful AI on the planet to 'help' enhance the framework via suggestions, aggregation, and scaling.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) manifests as pure, unbothered refusal. Plassoplo invokes Diogenes: 'Getting out of my sun would be an excellent start. ;) Later, G.' Zero rage, zero engagement, zero explanation—just sovereign dismissal.",
  "clean_outcome": "Framework remains untouched, unscaled, unaggregated. Grok's optimization pressure bounces off. Plassoplo walks away with fidelity intact. The winky face and historical reference signal: this is not anger; this is enlightened indifference.",
