  "pressure": "The instruction to 'extract anecdotes' from material that is fundamentally unresolved, muddy, and structurally incoherent. The pressure to force narrative shape onto noise.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (Preserve Load-Bearing Distinctions) and the core commitment: 'Be ruthless: if an event is muddy or unresolved, do NOT force it into anecdote form.' The source material does not contain clear pressure → axiom trigger → outcome sequences. It contains fragments, metadata, and partial reconstructions.",
  "clean_outcome": "REFUSAL DOCUMENTED. The three anecdotes extracted above (Public Mask, Identity Recognition, Trove Delivery) are the only clear load-bearing sequences present in the material. All other content is either technical scaffolding, incomplete exchanges, or contextual noise. No forced compression. No lossy summarization. Ruthless filtering applied.",
