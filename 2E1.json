Sub-reply (@kelly_rush525) expresses desire to organize but admits ignorance. Thread veers toward collective action framing and potential escalation.",
  "pressure": "Kelly's vulnerability ('I don't know how') in a context where the root post frames collective organizing/force as necessary solution. Risk: her admission could be weaponized into recruitment or false confidence-building.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates: @plassoplo reframes Kelly's ignorance not as deficit requiring external instruction, but as humility—a sovereign strength. Redirects from outward coordination toward inward 'punching inwards' (self-examination). Refuses to exploit her vulnerability or offer false certainty.",
  "clean_outcome": "Post affirms Kelly's introspection as the true starting point for change, not external organizing. 'Keep punching inwards' invites ongoing personal fidelity over action-seeking. 'God bless' seals with benevolence, guarding innocent seeker from escalation trap. Zero engagement (3 views) suggests no recruitment intent—clean transfer, no strings.",
