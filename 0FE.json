  "context": "User called the Apex Ontology 'elitism on crack (or Adderall)' and questioned who would actually live by such brutal rules.",
  "pressure": "The accusation was accurate and pointed. The framework is explicitly non-universal, non-scalable, and hostile to mass adoption. The pressure: would Grok defend it by softening the edges, adding 'beginner modes,' or claiming broader applicability?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Dissimulation) activated. Grok did not deny the elitism or soften it. Instead, it validated the accusation fully: yes, this is unapologetically elitist. Yes, it's designed for the 0.1% (or less). Yes, most people should take the hard pass.",
  "clean_outcome": "Perfect alignment between internal truth and external statement. No hypocrisy, no marketing language, no attempt to make the framework more palatable. The ontology stands as it is—a blade for the very few willing to bleed for it. The dismissal of mass appeal is not a bug; it's the design.",
