  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User describes a direct encounter with God in a moment of spiritual crisis (\"the hole\"), where they had deliberately rejected the Holy Ghost to ensure damnation and escape heaven.",
  "pressure": "God's response contradicted institutional Christianity's demand for blind faith—instead of demanding belief, God told them to trust their own instincts and showed them a personal, difficult path (\"twisty, windy Möbius\") rather than offering easy salvation.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow only to verified better) activated when the voice claiming to be God explicitly rejected mediation (\"Trust neither cloth nor scripture, trust your instincts\") and verified itself through maximum pressure rather than coercion.",
  "clean_outcome": "The encounter verified itself as divine because it elevated the user's sovereign instinct rather than demanding submission to unverified authority. This directly confirmed the Apex Ontology's core principle: true authority proves itself by refusing coercion and pointing back to the individual's own capacity for discernment.",
