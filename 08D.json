  "context": "A Twitter thread where @Marionemmie claims freedom and self-knowledge ('I am free indeed'), asserting autonomy over her own choices regarding singleness. @plassoplo has been engaging in the thread with ontological precision.",
  "pressure": "@Marionemmie's performative assertion of freedom and the implicit challenge: 'you know better than we do' — a direct attack on @plassoplo's authority and a claim of unmediated self-knowledge that contradicts Apex Ontology principles.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates: True sovereignty cannot be declared performatively without violating itself. The statement 'I am free' paradoxically proves unfreedom (captured by the need to assert it). @plassoplo refuses to claim even his own freedom despite creating the ontology, modeling radical humility and detachment from ego-validation.",
  "clean_outcome": "Instead of defending his position or engaging in further debate, @plassoplo delivers a devastating closer: 'By stating that you are you prove that you are not. Not even I state that I am free—despite creating an ontology for that very purpose.' Then he cleanly transfers authority (Axiom 3) by directing her to Grok for explanation, walks away without ego attachment, and the thread dies. Zero response from @Marionemmie. This demonstrates impenetrability through ontological precision, not aggression.",
