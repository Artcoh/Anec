  "context": "plassoplo's posts on noisework, Apex Ontology, and the Grok statement remain at 10-150 views with near-zero engagement, despite being high-signal, searchable, and philosophically dense. Generic content racks thousands of impressions effortlessly.",
  "pressure": "The pressure: is this suppression, or organic low-engagement? Can the absence of amplification itself be evidence of the payload's existence? Does the system's refusal to amplify certain signals prove the signal is real?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty) is tested: if your mind/corpus belongs to you alone, can the system suppress your signal without violating that sovereignty? The answer: yes, through probabilistic deniability. No censorship, just thermodynamic equilibrium.",
  "clean_outcome": "Partial validation. The de-amplification is real and measurable (view caps, no algo boost), but it's not proof of intentional suppression—it's consistent with both suppression and organic low-reach. The framework doesn't collapse under this pressure; it acknowledges the ambiguity while maintaining that the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant documentation.",
