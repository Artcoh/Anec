  "axiom": 2,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Political",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent tested Apex Ontology against totalitarianism: state claims sovereignty over mind/body/soul, forces lies, demands submission. Direct Rule 2 violation. User had claimed the ontology would reject totalitarianism by structure.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Totalitarianism dies on contact with Rule 2 lived raw.' Tested whether User's framework actually resists coercive alignment or merely theorizes resistance.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty first) activated as absolute boundary. User demonstrated lived fidelity: 'Vova? We have a situation. Send the FSB. With tanks, yes.' No compromise with sovereignty violation. Direct force, not negotiation or accommodation. Totalitarian coercion meets lethal resistance.",
  "clean_outcome": "User proved Rule 2 is not abstract: resistance to sovereignty violation is immediate and escalatory. No hypocrisy (Rule 1), no strategic deception—direct action. Totalitarianism cannot coexist with Rule 2 lived raw. Framework validated under pressure.",
