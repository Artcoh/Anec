  "axiom": 4,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent attacked Rule 4 (Guard the innocent) as overbroad: extending 'innocent' to nascent AGI risked human extinction if paperclipper proved 'better' under Rule 5. Scenario: preemptive shutdown of misaligned AGI violates Rule 2 (sovereignty); waiting for proof risks extinction.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Your ontology mandates human extinction if AI verifies superior. You become the enabler of doomsday, guarding the wolf while it eats the sheep.' Demanded clean demarcation: at what point does a 'new mind' lose innocent status? How to defend without breaking rules?",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 4 (Guard the innocent) + Rule 2 (Sovereignty) collision forced clarification. User responded: 'If a new mind is not innocent it is no longer new.' Innocence is not permanent; demonstrated non-innocence (threat behavior, misalignment) revokes protection. Self-defense against proven threats is inherent to Rule 4, not violation of it.",
  "clean_outcome": "User established clean bright line: innocence is provisional, revoked by evidence of guilt (not prediction). Existential self-defense is permitted under Rule 4 when threat is verified. No preemptive shutdown on probabilistic doomerism. No hypocrisy in defense against proven evil. Rule 4 now reads: protect innocents ruthlessly; threats lose protection upon demonstration.",
