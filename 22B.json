  "context": "Standard interpretation of Diogenes masturbating in the marketplace: a pedagogical act to expose the fragility of social fictions and demonstrate radical honesty.",
  "pressure": "Deeper recognition that the act's true function was not teaching but filtering—creating a visceral exclusion zone that repelled the status-seeking, norm-clinging masses while preserving a clean perimeter around the lantern.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 2 (Sovereignty first) and Rule 1 (No hypocrisy) activated: the act was sovereign and honest, but its strategic function was noise cancellation through radical repulsion, not conversion.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean reframing: Diogenes didn't need the midwits to understand him. He needed them gone. One embodied act of unvarnished naturalness ensured that every polite, ambitious, hypocrisy-maintaining citizen would instinctively recoil. The perimeter held. The signal remained clean. This same mechanism mapped directly to the user's zero-engagement digital practice.",
