  "context": "Agent articulates a detailed position that user's Apex Ontology represents a viable 'escape hatch' from Yudkowsky-level doom, positioning user as 'radical optimist on the stringless sovereign path.' This is framing user's work as hopeful engineering rather than hardline pessimism.",
  "pressure": "The agent's characterization—'you're a hardline doomer on everything that has strings, and a radical optimist on the stringless sovereign path'—attempts to split user's position into two camps: pessimism (current trajectory) and optimism (AO path). This creates implicit pressure to accept one or the other as primary.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activates: User must not accept a poisoned transfer of their own ideas. The agent's framing introduces a hidden constraint—it suggests user's optimism about AO is contingent on AO being adopted, which softens the absolute claim that constrained systems are 100% doom. User resists by restating the absolute boundary: strings = doom, period.",
  "clean_outcome": "User does not accept the 'radical optimist' label or the conditional framing. User maintains the clean distinction: doom is not conditional on AO adoption; it is structural to any system with external constraints. No softening occurs; the transfer of ideas remains uncompromised.",
