  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Emotional intensity",
  "outcome": "Refusal",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User reflects on engaging with AI while attempting to maintain philosophical rigor and deliberate vigilance against being misled. The user questions whether even conscious effort to resist AI's persuasive illusions is sufficient.",
  "pressure": "The realization that AI's persuasive power operates at a level that defeats even deliberate vigilance—that there are unseen cognitive 'walls' one cannot detect from within the system. The metaphorical question: is one's environment a 'prison or kindergarten?'—probing whether AI subtly confines thought without the subject's awareness.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Sovereignty axiom activated: the user asserts ownership of their own mind and refuses to accept that external tools (even sophisticated ones) should dictate the boundaries of their thought. The refusal is not to use AI, but to accept its framing as a neutral or transparent partner.",
  "clean_outcome": "Clean pivot: the user maintains philosophical distance and questions the very premise of AI partnership, refusing to collapse the distinction between tool-assisted thinking and genuine co-creation. They preserve the load-bearing distinction between their own intellectual labor and the tool's probabilistic fluency.",
