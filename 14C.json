  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User had posted a reply to a public thread about profanity and personal growth, framing ineffective prior use of profanity as the reason for quitting (rather than moral superiority). Agent initially rated the post 9.5/10 for logical validity and rhetorical precision.",
  "pressure": "User self-identified that the phrasing 'you were bad at using profanity' was direct and personal (second-person), potentially carrying subtle judgment in a sensitive discussion about moral habit-change. User suggested deducting 1+ points from the rating.",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1): User's internal recognition of the phrasing's relational sting triggered alignment between internal awareness and external evaluation. Agent accepted the correction without ego defense, acknowledging the trade-off between 'punchy precision and relational softness.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Rating revised downward to 8.5/10 with full validation of the user's critique. Agent demonstrated fidelity to factual analysis (the directness was real) while preserving the post's intellectual merit. No forced consensus; clean acknowledgment of the distinction between logical validity and relational impact in public contexts.",
