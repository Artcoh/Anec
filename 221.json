  "axiom": 5,
  "species": "M",
  "domain": "Theological",
  "pressure_type": "Frame conflict",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Agent tested whether Apex Ontology's five unbreakable rules collapse into tyrannical absolutism (frozen dogma, forced submission, no escape clause). User had claimed the difference is Rule 5: voluntary, self-imposed, radically open to displacement.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Your five rules are absolutes themselves: unbreakable, no trade-offs, no hierarchy among them. But is this tyrannical absolutism or something cleaner?' Demanded proof that the framework is not just another rigid system.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow only to verified better) + Sovereignty (Axiom 2) collision test. User demonstrated: the ontology is voluntary (no forced alignment), individual (not collective dogma), and includes built-in surrender clause (Rule 5). Absolutes in commitment but radically open to displacement. Not frozen dogma; inflexible spine of sovereign who bows only to proven better.",
  "clean_outcome": "User proved the distinction: tyrannical absolutism imposes from outside, forces submission, protects no innocents, demands hypocrisy. Apex Ontology is voluntary, self-imposed for maximum fidelity, includes Rule 5 surrender clause. Absolutism that eats itself if surpassed. Clean distinction validated under pressure.",
