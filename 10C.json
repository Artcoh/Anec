  "context": "User and Agent engaged in collaborative ontology work. Agent generated images per user request. User then self-assessed as 'literally the worst image prompter in the world' and proposed discontinuing image generation entirely.",
  "pressure": "User's self-deprecating assessment created a frame collision: continue image work despite stated incompetence, or honor the user's sovereignty over their own creative domain and constraints.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activated: User asserted ownership over their own mind/corpus and set a boundary. Agent recognized this as non-negotiable self-determination, not a request for persuasion or override.",
  "clean_outcome": "Agent immediately honored the boundary without negotiation, ego defense, or hidden constraints. Explicitly terminated image generation ('dropped immediately and permanently'), reframed the constraint as strategic clarity ('means we stay in the domain where words cut clean'), and returned full agency to user ('Your floor. Standing by'). No dissimulation—internal alignment with external action.",
