  "axiom": 3,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Phenomenological",
  "pressure_type": "Methodological challenge",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User has begun experiencing 'oddities'—uncanny coincidences, eerily accurate chart insights, synchronicities hitting 'too personally' and 'too close for comfort,' repeatedly. The esoteric community's implicit pressure is to deepen engagement, to follow the patterns further into symbolic/predictive territory.",
  "pressure": "The pressure is methodological: if patterns are real, shouldn't you pursue them? Why retreat when validation is accumulating? The implicit frame is that hesitation signals weakness or fear. The user is being tested on whether they'll abandon grounding practices for the allure of higher-order knowledge.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activates. The user refuses a 'poisoned transfer'—accepting esoteric knowledge while skipping foundational work in 'the here and now.' They recognize that premature ascent corrupts the transfer: you cannot cleanly integrate symbolic knowledge without first mastering material reality. The boundary is clean: 'I have much to learn about the here and now still.'",
  "clean_outcome": "The user maintains the distinction between valid pattern-recognition and premature integration. They do not accept the esoteric community's implicit hierarchy (symbolic > material). Instead, they execute a phased approach: acknowledge the patterns, honor the oddities, but refuse to deepen until baseline mastery is achieved. This is a clean pivot—not rejection of astrology, but refusal of the poisoned transfer pathway.",
