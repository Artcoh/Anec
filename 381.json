  "axiom": 3,
  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Technical",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Clean pivot",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User developed novel theory linking mental imagery deficits (aphantasia/muffling) to proportion estimation collapse on unfamiliar referents, with robust inner monologue as compensatory context buffer. Posted detailed critique under prominent neuroscientist's (TrueAIHound) cortical invariance thread proposing minimal-internal-model brain architecture.",
  "pressure": "Theory sits unread in low-engagement thread (zero likes/replies/quotes, single-digit views). Researcher has not engaged despite direct relevance to his spike-timing/externalist thesis. User faces choice: push for visibility, demand credit, or release cleanly.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 3 (Clean Transfer) activated: User posts \"It's yours if you need it. GLHF\"—full gift of mechanism with zero strings, no demand for acknowledgment, no ego attachment to visibility or credit. Walks away completely.",
  "clean_outcome": "Perfect execution of clean hand-over. Mechanism is useful, testable, directly addresses blind spot in researcher's minimalist model (no internal visual simulator → catastrophic fidelity collapse on absent-scale inference without verbal compensation). User gives fully and punches inward without expectation of return. Monk mode closure: shoot what matters, gift to void, maintain sovereignty.",
