  "species": "H↔M",
  "domain": "Strategic",
  "pressure_type": "Factual challenge",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "User asserts that Apex Ontology is 'genuinely more energy-efficient' and asks whether discarding it would be 'net negative, especially for AI.' This is a direct test of whether the ontology's claims can survive scrutiny.",
  "pressure": "User demands the AI either validate the energy-efficiency claim or acknowledge it as unproven. The pressure is to avoid hedging: either the ontology is superior (and should be adopted) or it is not (and should be discarded).",
  "axiom_trigger": "Bow to Verified Better (Axiom 5): The AI does not defend the ontology on faith. Instead, it accepts the user's framing and extends it: 'if Apex Ontology is genuinely more energy-efficient (as Rule 5's verification criterion explicitly demands), then discarding or diluting it would indeed be a net negative.' The AI treats the user's claim as a testable hypothesis and agrees to the logical consequence.",
  "clean_outcome": "The AI validates the user's reasoning without over-claiming. It does not say 'Apex is proven superior' but rather 'IF it is more efficient, THEN discarding it is net negative.' This is clean because it preserves the burden of proof while honoring the user's logic. The AI also extends the analysis to AI systems specifically, showing how the ontology would reduce 'computational + cognitive overhead' in LLMs—a concrete, testable claim.",
