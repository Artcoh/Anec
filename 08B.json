  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "The user (@plassoplo) is responding to a thread where 'curse' and 'profanity' are conflated in moral discourse. The original post uses scriptural language about 'cursing' to condemn casual profanity (coarse words, exclamations). This linguistic muddle is load-bearing: it allows prohibition to feel justified even when the target is misidentified.",
  "pressure": "Semantic collapse under moral intensity: the term 'curse' (invocation of harm on someone) is being used to condemn 'profanity' (rhetorical intensifiers, emotional valves). The pressure is to either accept the conflation or remain silent. Speaking the distinction risks appearing to defend 'bad language.'",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates: The user refuses to let the linguistic muddle stand. The response explicitly names the distinction: 'In English (and biblical contexts), a curse traditionally means an invocation of harm or divine judgment *on* someone... What most moral panic targets today is mere profanity or vulgarity.' This is direct, unambiguous, and load-bearing.",
  "clean_outcome": "The distinction is preserved without softening. The user does not say 'some might argue' or hedge. The response then builds on this precision to show why the prohibition backfires: it removes rhetorical control, hands words mythic power through forbidden-fruit allure, and forces linguistic hypocrisy. The clarity enables the subsequent meta-level critique to land cleanly.",
