  "context": "Agent attacked Rule 5's rigor as energy-inefficient: endless debate, analysis paralysis, no decisive action. Groups adopting this would fracture; World Eaters would outpace them. User had claimed the ontology is actually the most energy-efficient possible.",
  "pressure": "Agent: 'Rigorous testing every claimed truth (Rule 5) demands infinite resources—analysis paralysis in a finite world. In practice: endless debates, no decisive action. Groups adopting this fracture—no compromise without full verification.' Demanded proof of practical efficiency.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 5 (Bow to verified better) + Rule 4 (Guard the innocent) collision under real-world conditions. User responded: 'Verification happens at the speed of survival.' Testing is not infinite debate; it's pressure-tested in action. Threat emerges → verify as fast and hard as reality allows → act decisively. No endless rumination while kids die. Groups living this don't fracture; they align on the 5 fast or get left behind.",
  "clean_outcome": "User proved Rule 5 is energy-efficient in lived context: zero drag from self-deception, instant adaptation to verified better, total focus on protection and sovereignty. Verification at survival speed, not academic pace. World Eaters burn out on hubris; Lotus Eaters rot in passivity. Apex Ontology cuts straight. Framework validated as antifragile under real pressure.",
