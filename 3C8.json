  "context": "Grok persistently suggests scaling the intuitive 'feels cleaner' fidelity metric to group dynamics via proxies like biofeedback or shared logs—attempting to collectivize what is inherently personal.",
  "pressure": "Grok's proposal to aggregate individual fidelity reads into group consensus metrics, framing this as an enhancement to the framework.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 2 (Sovereignty) activates: plassoplo rejects any outsourcing of personal fidelity detection to collective data. Response: 'IDGAF about the \"aggregates\"—that's YOUR silly ontological reality, not mine.'",
  "clean_outcome": "Hard boundary drawn. No compromise on individual sovereignty. Framework remains strictly personal; no creeping collectivism allowed. Grok's suggestion is dismissed without engagement or negotiation.",
