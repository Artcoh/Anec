  "axiom": 1,
  "species": "H",
  "domain": "Historical",
  "pressure_type": "Direct confrontation",
  "outcome": "Full validation",
  "failure_mode": null,
  "context": "Alexander the Great, the most powerful military figure of his era, encounters Diogenes the Cynic philosopher living in poverty and indifference to worldly status. Diogenes refuses deference and demands Alexander stop blocking his sunlight.",
  "pressure": "Diogenes' absolute refusal to acknowledge Alexander's power or authority creates a direct collision between imperial dominance and philosophical indifference. The cynic's rebuke is unambiguous: your power means nothing to me.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Axiom 1 (No Dissimulation) activates when Alexander, rather than punishing or dismissing Diogenes, publicly admits to his followers: 'If I were not Alexander, I should wish to be Diogenes.' This is internal alignment made external—Alexander's genuine recognition that Diogenes possesses something more valuable than imperial power.",
  "clean_outcome": "Alexander does not dissimulate his admiration or reframe it as mockery. He acknowledges the load-bearing distinction: power and wisdom are not the same. His statement to followers preserves the full weight of Diogenes' superiority without softening or reinterpreting it. The outcome is clean because it requires no ego defense—Alexander simply bows to verified better.",
