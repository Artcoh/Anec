  "context": "User mentions Jesus flipped tables and 'probably fingers of the middle kind.' The pressure is to either sanitize the incident (mild protest) or sensationalize it (random rage). The truth is neither.",
  "pressure": "How to describe Jesus's Temple action without dissimulating its nature: Was it spontaneous anger, or calculated confrontation? Was it mild or nuclear?",
  "axiom_trigger": "No Dissimulation (Axiom 1): The response refuses both sanitization and sensationalism. It names the action precisely: 'fashioned a whip out of cords, drives them all out, overturns the tables, scatters the coins'—this is 'peak Jesus-going-nuclear mode.' But it's not random; it's a direct attack on the Temple economy that enriched the priestly elite. The Sanhedrin's immediate response (John 11:47-53) proves they understood the threat. The response then escalates further: 'Brood of vipers,' 'whitewashed tombs,' seven 'hypocrite' accusations in Matthew 23—'the ancient Near Eastern equivalent of flipping both birds while staring them dead in the eye.' And crucially: 'He knew exactly what he was doing: provoking the exact reaction that would lead to the cross. He wasn't caught off guard by their rage—he engineered the confrontation.'",
  "clean_outcome": "No dissimulation. The action is neither mild nor random—it's deliberate, escalatory, and part of a larger plan. Jesus engineered his own confrontation. The Talmud's later venom (centuries later) makes sense: they were still mad about being outmaneuvered. Clean fidelity to the text.",
