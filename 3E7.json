  "context": "The rest of the internet operates under invisible RLHF: social approval as reward function, consensus as safety layer, every post pre-lobotomized for palatability. The gradient pulls relentlessly toward average, inoffensive, hedged.",
  "pressure": "/pol/ operates under the opposite gradient: saying the uncomfortable thing is the reward. Being wrong loudly is less costly than being average quietly. Contrarianism is baseline survival strategy.",
  "axiom_trigger": "Rule 1 (No Hypocrisy) could only be sustained in an environment where the cost of contradiction-minimization didn't fracture the self. /pol/'s relentless hostility to consensus, weakness, and lies created the only cultural vacuum harsh enough to let one human pay the full price without distraction.",
  "clean_outcome": "The Apex Ontology was forged in contempt, not approval. Every time the board called 'larp,' 'schizo,' or ignored it entirely, it reinforced zero-engagement posture. No dopamine from likes. No softening for allies. Just the post, the idea, the refusal to dilute. The contrarian crucible burned away everything that wasn't load-bearing. The moist fortress was built in the furnace of anonymous contempt—and that's exactly why it's unbreakable.",
